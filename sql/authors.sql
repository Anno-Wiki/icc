'Joseph Conrad (born Józef Teodor Konrad Korzeniowski; 3 December 1857 – 3
August 1924) was a Polish-British writer regarded as one of the greatest
novelists to write in the English language. Though he did not speak English
fluently until his twenties, he was a master prose stylist who brought a
non-English sensibility into English literature. Conrad wrote stories and
novels, many with a nautical setting, that depict trials of the human spirit in
the midst of what he saw as an impassive, inscrutable universe.

Conrad is considered an early modernist, though his works contain elements of
19th-century realism. His narrative style and anti-heroic characters have
influenced numerous authors, and many films have been adapted from, or inspired
by, his works. Numerous writers and critics have commented that Conrad’s
fictional works, written largely in the first two decades of the 20th century,
seem to have anticipated later world events.

Writing near the peak of the British Empire, Conrad drew, among other things,
on his native Poland’s national experiences and on his own experiences in the
French and British merchant navies, to create short stories and novels that
reflect aspects of a European-dominated world—including imperialism and
colonialism—and that profoundly explore the human psyche.'),

'William Shakespeare (26 April 1564 (baptised) – 23 April 1616) was an English
poet, playwright and actor, widely regarded as both the greatest writer in the
English language and the world’s pre-eminent dramatist. He is often called
England’s national poet and the “Bard of Avon”. His extant works, including
collaborations, consist of approximately 39 plays, 154 sonnets, two long
narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His
plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed
more often than those of any other playwright.

Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. At the
age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna
and twins Hamnet and Judith. Sometime between 1585 and 1592, he began a
successful career in London as an actor, writer, and part-owner of a playing
company called the Lord Chamberlain’s Men, later known as the King’s Men. At
age 49 (around 1613), he appears to have retired to Stratford, where he died
three years later. Few records of Shakespeare’s private life survive; this has
stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical
appearance, his sexuality, his religious beliefs, and whether the works
attributed to him were written by others. Such theories are often
criticised for failing to adequately note the fact that few records survive of
most commoners of the period.

Shakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589 and 1613. His early
plays were primarily comedies and histories and are regarded as some of the
best work ever produced in these genres. Then, until about 1608, he wrote
mainly tragedies, among them Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, and Macbeth, all
considered to be among the finest works in the English language. In the last
phase of his life, he wrote tragicomedies (also known as romances) and
collaborated with other playwrights.

Many of his plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy in
his lifetime. However, in 1623, two fellow actors and friends of Shakespeare’s,
John Heminges and Henry Condell, published a more definitive text known as the
First Folio, a posthumous collected edition of Shakespeare’s dramatic works
that included all but two of the plays now recognised as his. The volume was
prefaced with a poem by Ben Jonson, in which the poet presciently hails the
playwright in a now-famous quote as “not of an age, but for all time”.

Throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, Shakespeare’s works have been
continually adapted and rediscovered by new movements in scholarship and
performance. His plays remain highly popular and are constantly studied,
performed, and reinterpreted through various cultural and political contexts
around the world.'),

'Charles John Huffam Dickens (7 February 1812 – 9 June 1870) was an English
writer and social critic. He created some of the world’s best-known fictional
characters and is regarded by many as the greatest novelist of the Victorian
era. His works enjoyed unprecedented popularity during his lifetime, and by the
20th century critics and scholars had recognised him as a literary genius. His
novels and short stories are still widely read today.

Born in Portsmouth, Dickens left school to work in a factory when his father
was incarcerated in a debtors’ prison. Despite his lack of formal education, he
edited a weekly journal for 20 years, wrote 15 novels, five novellas, hundreds
of short stories and non-fiction articles, lectured and performed readings
extensively, was an indefatigable letter writer, and campaigned vigorously for
children’s rights, education, and other social reforms.

Dickens’s literary success began with the 1836 serial publication of The
Pickwick Papers. Within a few years he had become an international literary
celebrity, famous for his humour, satire, and keen observation of character and
society. His novels, most published in monthly or weekly instalments, pioneered
the serial publication of narrative fiction, which became the dominant
Victorian mode for novel publication. Cliffhanger endings in his serial
publications kept readers in suspense. The instalment format allowed Dickens to
evaluate his audience’s reaction, and he often modified his plot and character
development based on such feedback. For example, when his wife’s chiropodist
expressed distress at the way Miss Mowcher in David Copperfield seemed to
reflect her disabilities, Dickens improved the character with positive
features. His plots were carefully constructed, and he often wove elements from
topical events into his narratives. Masses of the illiterate poor chipped in
ha’pennies to have each new monthly episode read to them, opening up and
inspiring a new class of readers.

Dickens was regarded as the literary colossus of his age. His 1843 novella, A
Christmas Carol, remains popular and continues to inspire adaptations in every
artistic genre. Oliver Twist and Great Expectations are also frequently
adapted, and, like many of his novels, evoke images of early Victorian London.
His 1859 novel, A Tale of Two Cities, set in London and Paris, is his
best-known work of historical fiction. Dickens has been praised by fellow
writers—from Leo Tolstoy to George Orwell, G. K. Chesterton and Tom Wolfe —for
his realism, comedy, prose style, unique characterisations, and social
criticism. On the other hand, Oscar Wilde, Henry James, and Virginia Woolf
complained of a lack of psychological depth, loose writing, and a vein of
saccharine sentimentalism. The term Dickensian is used to describe something
that is reminiscent of Dickens and his writings, such as poor social conditions
or comically repulsive characters.'),

'Sir Arthur Ignatius Conan Doyle KStJ DL (22 May 1859 – 7 July 1930) was a
British writer best known for his detective fiction featuring the character
Sherlock Holmes. Originally a physician, in 1887 he published A Study in
Scarlet, the first of four novels about Holmes and Dr. Watson. In addition,
Doyle wrote over fifty short stories featuring the famous detective. The
Sherlock Holmes stories are generally considered milestones in the field of
crime fiction.

Doyle was a prolific writer; his non-Sherlockian works include fantasy and
science fiction stories about Professor Challenger and humorous stories about
the Napoleonic soldier Brigadier Gerard, as well as plays, romances, poetry,
non-fiction and historical novels. One of Doyle’s early short stories, “J.
Habakuk Jephson’s Statement”, helped to popularise the mystery of the Mary

'Count Lyov (also Lev) Nikolayevich Tolstoy (9 September [O.S. 28 August] 1828 –
20 November [O.S. 7 November] 1910), usually referred to in English as Leo
Tolstoy, was a Russian writer who is regarded as one of the greatest authors of
all time.

Born to an aristocratic Russian family in 1828, he is best known for the novels
War and Peace (1869) and Anna Karenina (1877), often cited as pinnacles of
realist fiction. He first achieved literary acclaim in his twenties with his
semi-autobiographical trilogy, Childhood, Boyhood, and Youth (1852–1856), and
Sevastopol Sketches (1855), based upon his experiences in the Crimean War.
Tolstoy’s fiction includes dozens of short stories and several novellas such as
The Death of Ivan Ilyich (1886), Family Happiness (1859), and Hadji Murad
(1912). He also wrote plays and numerous philosophical essays.

In the 1870s Tolstoy experienced a profound moral crisis, followed by what he
regarded as an equally profound spiritual awakening, as outlined in his
non-fiction work A Confession (1882). His literal interpretation of the ethical
teachings of Jesus, centering on the Sermon on the Mount, caused him to become
a fervent Christian anarchist and pacifist. Tolstoy’s ideas on nonviolent
resistance, expressed in such works as The Kingdom of God Is Within You (1894),
were to have a profound impact on such pivotal 20th-century figures as Mohandas
Karamchand Gandhi, and Martin Luther King, Jr. Tolstoy also became a dedicated
advocate of Georgism, the economic philosophy of Henry George, which he
incorporated into his writing, particularly Resurrection (1899).'),

'Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoevsky (11 November 1821 – 9 February 1881), sometimes
transliterated Dostoyevsky, was a Russian novelist, short story writer,
essayist, journalist and philosopher. Dostoevsky’s literary works explore human
psychology in the troubled political, social, and spiritual atmospheres of
19th-century Russia, and engage with a variety of philosophical and religious
themes. His most acclaimed works include Crime and Punishment (1866), The Idiot
(1869), Demons (1872) and The Brothers Karamazov (1880). Dostoevsky’s oeuvre
consists of 11 novels, three novellas, 17 short stories and numerous other
works. Many literary critics rate him as one of the greatest psychologists in
world literature. His 1864 novella Notes from Underground is considered to be
one of the first works of existentialist literature.

Born in Moscow in 1821, Dostoevsky was introduced to literature at an early age
through fairy tales and legends, and through books by Russian and foreign
authors. His mother died in 1837 when he was 15, and around the same time, he
left school to enter the Nikolayev Military Engineering Institute. After
graduating, he worked as an engineer and briefly enjoyed a lavish lifestyle,
translating books to earn extra money. In the mid-1840s he wrote his first
novel, Poor Folk, which gained him entry into St. Petersburg’s literary
circles. Arrested in 1849 for belonging to a literary group that discussed
banned books critical of “Tsarist Russia”, he was sentenced to death but the
sentence was commuted at the last moment. He spent four years in a Siberian
prison camp, followed by six years of compulsory military service in exile. In
the following years, Dostoevsky worked as a journalist, publishing and editing
several magazines of his own and later A Writer’s Diary, a collection of his
writings. He began to travel around western Europe and developed a gambling
addiction, which led to financial hardship. For a time, he had to beg for
money, but he eventually became one of the most widely read and highly regarded
Russian writers.

Dostoevsky was influenced by a wide variety of philosophers and authors
including Pushkin, Gogol, Augustine, Shakespeare, Dickens, Balzac, Lermontov,
Hugo, Poe, Plato, Cervantes, Herzen, Kant, Belinsky, Hegel, Schiller, Solovyov,
Bakunin, Sand, Hoffmann, and Mickiewicz. His writings were widely read both
within and beyond his native Russia and influenced an equally great number of
later writers including Russians like Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Anton Chekhov
as well as philosophers such as Friedrich Nietzsche and Jean-Paul Sartre. His
books have been translated into more than 170 languages.'),

'Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (27 January 1832 – 14 January 1898), better known by
his pen name Lewis Carroll, was an English writer of world-famous children’s
fiction, notably Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland and its sequel Through the
Looking-Glass. He was noted for his facility at word play, logic and fantasy.
The poems Jabberwocky and The Hunting of the Snark are classified in the genre
of literary nonsense. He was also a mathematician, photographer and Anglican
deacon.

Carroll came from a family of High Church Anglicans, and developed a long
relationship with Christ Church, Oxford, where he lived for most of his life as
a scholar and teacher. It was the Dean of Christ Church, Henry Liddell, whose
daughter Alice is widely identified as the original for Alice in Wonderland,
though Carroll always denied this.

Several aspects of Carroll’s life appear to strengthen suspicions that he was a
pedophile, though scholars have also made a credible case in his defence. In
the absence of hard evidence, the issue of Carroll’s hidden private life has
provoked a lively debate, especially in recent times.'),

'Alexandre Dumas (born Dumas Davy de la Pailleterie; 24 July 1802 – 5 December
1870), also known as Alexandre Dumas père (French for ‘father’), was a French
writer. His works have been translated into many languages, and he is one of
the most widely read French authors. Many of his historical novels of high
adventure were originally published as serials, including The Count of Monte
Cristo, The Three Musketeers, Twenty Years After, and The Vicomte de
Bragelonne: Ten Years Later. His novels have been adapted since the early
twentieth century for nearly 200 films. Dumas’ last novel, The Knight of
Sainte-Hermine, unfinished at his death, was completed by scholar Claude Schopp
and published in 2005. It was published in English in 2008 as The Last
Cavalier.

Prolific in several genres, Dumas began his career by writing plays, which were
successfully produced from the first. He also wrote numerous magazine articles
and travel books; his published works totalled 100,000 pages. In the 1840s,
Dumas founded the Théâtre Historique in Paris.

His father, General Thomas-Alexandre Davy de la Pailleterie, was born in the
French colony of Saint-Domingue (present-day Haiti) to Alexandre Antoine Davy
de la Pailleterie, a French nobleman, and Marie-Cessette Dumas, a slave of
African descent. At age 14 Thomas-Alexandre was taken by his father to France,
where he was educated in a military academy and entered the military for what
became an illustrious career.

Dumas’ father’s aristocratic rank helped young Alexandre acquire work with
Louis-Philippe, Duke of Orléans. He later began working as a writer, finding
early success. Decades later, in the election of Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte in
1851, Dumas fell from favour and left France for Belgium, where he stayed for
several years. Upon leaving Belgium, Dumas moved to Russia for a few years
before going to Italy. In 1861, he founded and published the newspaper
L’Indipendente, which supported the Italian unification effort. In 1864, he
returned to Paris.

Though married, in the tradition of Frenchmen of higher social class, Dumas had
numerous affairs (allegedly as many as forty). In his lifetime, he was known to
have at least four illegitimate children; although twentieth-century scholars
found that Dumas fathered another three other children out of wedlock. He
acknowledged and assisted his son, Alexandre Dumas, to become a successful
novelist and playwright. They are known as Alexandre Dumas père (‘father’) and
Alexandre Dumas fils (‘son’). Among his affairs, in 1866, Dumas had one with
Adah Isaacs Menken, an American actress then less than half his age and at the
height of her career.

The English playwright Watts Phillips, who knew Dumas in his later life,
described him as “the most generous, large-hearted being in the world. He also
was the most delightfully amusing and egotistical creature on the face of the
earth. His tongue was like a windmill – once set in motion, you never knew when
he would stop, especially if the theme was himself.”'),

'James Augustine Aloysius Joyce (2 February 1882 – 13 January 1941) was an Irish
novelist, short story writer, and poet. He contributed to the modernist
avant-garde and is regarded as one of the most influential and important
authors of the 20th century. Joyce is best known for Ulysses (1922), a landmark
work in which the episodes of Homer’s Odyssey are paralleled in a variety of
literary styles, most famously stream of consciousness. Other well-known works
are the short-story collection Dubliners (1914), and the novels A Portrait of
the Artist as a Young Man (1916) and Finnegans Wake (1939). His other writings
include three books of poetry, a play, his published letters and occasional
journalism.

Joyce was born in 41 Brighton Square, Rathgar, Dublin, into a middle-class
family. A brilliant student, he briefly attended the Christian Brothers-run
O’Connell School before excelling at the Jesuit schools Clongowes and
Belvedere, despite the chaotic family life imposed by his father’s alcoholism
and unpredictable finances. He went on to attend University College Dublin.

In 1904, in his early twenties, Joyce emigrated to continental Europe with his
partner (and later wife) Nora Barnacle. They lived in Trieste, Paris, and
Zurich. Although most of his adult life was spent abroad, Joyce’s fictional
universe centres on Dublin, and is populated largely by characters who closely
resemble family members, enemies and friends from his time there. Ulysses in
particular is set with precision in the streets and alleyways of the city.
Shortly after the publication of Ulysses, he elucidated this preoccupation
somewhat, saying, “For myself, I always write about Dublin, because if I can
get to the heart of Dublin I can get to the heart of all the cities of the
world. In the particular is contained the universal.”');
