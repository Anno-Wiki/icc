2@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@The Nellie, a cruising yawl, swung to her anchor without a flutter of the sails,
3@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@and was at rest. The flood had made, the wind was nearly calm, and being bound
4@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@down the river, the only thing for it was to come to and wait for the turn of
5@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@the tide.
6@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@The sea-reach of the Thames stretched before us like the beginning of an
7@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@interminable waterway. In the offing the sea and the sky were welded together
8@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@without a joint, and in the luminous space the tanned sails of the barges
9@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@drifting up with the tide seemed to stand still in red clusters of canvas
10@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@sharply peaked, with gleams of varnished sprits. A haze rested on the low shores
11@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@that ran out to sea in vanishing flatness. The air was dark above Gravesend, and
12@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@farther back still seemed condensed into a mournful gloom, brooding motionless
13@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@over the biggest, and the greatest, town on earth.
14@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@The Director of Companies was our captain and our host. We four affectionately
15@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@watched his back as he stood in the bows looking to seaward.  On the whole river
16@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@there was nothing that looked half so nautical. He resembled a pilot, which to a
17@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@seaman is trustworthiness personified. It was difficult to realize his work was
18@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@not out there in the luminous estuary, but behind him, within the brooding
19@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@gloom.
20@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@Between us there was, as I have already said somewhere, the bond of the sea.
21@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@Besides holding our hearts together through long periods of separation, it had
22@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@the effect of making us tolerant of each other’s yarns—and even convictions. The
23@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@Lawyer—the best of old fellows—had, because of his many years and many virtues,
24@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@the only cushion on deck, and was lying on the only rug. The Accountant had
25@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@brought out already a box of dominoes, and was toying architecturally with the
26@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@bones. Marlow sat cross-legged right aft, leaning against the mizzen-mast. He
27@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@had sunken cheeks, a yellow complexion, a straight back, an ascetic aspect, and,
28@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@with his arms dropped, the palms of hands outwards, resembled an idol. The
29@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@director, satisfied the anchor had good hold, made his way aft and sat down
30@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@amongst us. We exchanged a few words lazily. Afterwards there was silence on
31@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@board the yacht. For some reason or other we did not begin that game of
32@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@dominoes. We felt meditative, and fit for nothing but placid staring. The day
33@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@was ending in a serenity of still and exquisite brilliance. The water shone
34@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@pacifically; the sky, without a speck, was a benign immensity of unstained
35@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@light; the very mist on the Essex marsh was like a gauzy and radiant fabric,
36@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@hung from the wooded rises inland, and draping the low shores in diaphanous
37@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@folds. Only the gloom to the west, brooding over the upper reaches, became more
38@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@sombre every minute, as if angered by the approach of the sun.
39@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@And at last, in its curved and imperceptible fall, the sun sank low, and from
40@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@glowing white changed to a dull red without rays and without heat, as if about
41@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@to go out suddenly, stricken to death by the touch of that gloom brooding over a
42@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@crowd of men.
43@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@Forthwith a change came over the waters, and the serenity became less brilliant
44@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@but more profound. The old river in its broad reach rested unruffled at the
45@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@decline of day, after ages of good service done to the race that peopled its
46@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@banks, spread out in the tranquil dignity of a waterway leading to the uttermost
47@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@ends of the earth. We looked at the venerable stream not in the vivid flush of a
48@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@short day that comes and departs for ever, but in the august light of abiding
49@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@memories. And indeed nothing is easier for a man who has, as the phrase goes,
50@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@“followed the sea” with reverence and affection, than to evoke the great spirit
51@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@of the past upon the lower reaches of the Thames. The tidal current runs to and
52@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@fro in its unceasing service, crowded with memories of men and ships it had
53@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@borne to the rest of home or to the battles of the sea. It had known and served
54@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@all the men of whom the nation is proud, from Sir Francis Drake to Sir John
55@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@Franklin, knights all, titled and untitled—the great knights-errant of the sea.
56@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@It had borne all the ships whose names are like jewels flashing in the night of
57@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@time, from the _Golden Hind_ returning with her rotund flanks full of treasure,
58@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@to be visited by the Queen’s Highness and thus pass out of the gigantic tale, to
59@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@the _Erebus_ and _Terror_, bound on other conquests—and that never returned. It
60@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@had known the ships and the men. They had sailed from Deptford, from Greenwich,
61@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@from Erith—the adventurers and the settlers; kings’ ships and the ships of men
62@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@on ’Change; captains, admirals, the dark “interlopers” of the Eastern trade, and
63@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@the commissioned “generals” of East India fleets. Hunters for gold or pursuers
64@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@of fame, they all had gone out on that stream, bearing the sword, and often the
65@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@torch, messengers of the might within the land, bearers of a spark from the
66@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@sacred fire. What greatness had not floated on the ebb of that river into the
67@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@mystery of an unknown earth!... The dreams of men, the seed of commonwealths,
68@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@the germs of empires.
69@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@The sun set; the dusk fell on the stream, and lights began to appear along the
70@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@shore. The Chapman light-house, a three-legged thing erect on a mud-flat, shone
71@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@strongly. Lights of ships moved in the fairway—a great stir of lights going up
72@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@and going down. And farther west on the upper reaches the place of the monstrous
73@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@town was still marked ominously on the sky, a brooding gloom in sunshine, a
74@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@lurid glare under the stars.
75@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@“And this also,” said Marlow suddenly, “has been one of the dark places of the
76@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@earth.”
77@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@He was the only man of us who still “followed the sea.” The worst that could be
78@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@said of him was that he did not represent his class. He was a seaman, but he was
79@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@a wanderer, too, while most seamen lead, if one may so express it, a sedentary
80@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@life. Their minds are of the stay-at-home order, and their home is always with
81@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@them—the ship; and so is their country—the sea. One ship is very much like
82@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@another, and the sea is always the same. In the immutability of their
83@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@surroundings the foreign shores, the foreign faces, the changing immensity of
84@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@life, glide past, veiled not by a sense of mystery but by a slightly disdainful
85@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@ignorance; for there is nothing mysterious to a seaman unless it be the sea
86@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@itself, which is the mistress of his existence and as inscrutable as Destiny.
87@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@For the rest, after his hours of work, a casual stroll or a casual spree on
88@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@shore suffices to unfold for him the secret of a whole continent, and generally
89@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@he finds the secret not worth knowing. The yarns of seamen have a direct
90@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@simplicity, the whole meaning of which lies within the shell of a cracked nut.
91@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@But Marlow was not typical (if his propensity to spin yarns be excepted), and to
92@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@him the meaning of an episode was not inside like a kernel but outside,
93@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@enveloping the tale which brought it out only as a glow brings out a haze, in
94@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@the likeness of one of these misty halos that sometimes are made visible by the
95@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@spectral illumination of moonshine.
96@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@His remark did not seem at all surprising. It was just like Marlow. It was
97@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@accepted in silence. No one took the trouble to grunt even; and presently he
98@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@said, very slow—“I was thinking of very old times, when the Romans first came
99@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@here, nineteen hundred years ago—the other day .... Light came out of this river
100@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@since—you say Knights? Yes; but it is like a running blaze on a plain, like a
101@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@flash of lightning in the clouds. We live in the flicker—may it last as long as
102@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@the old earth keeps rolling! But darkness was here yesterday. Imagine the
103@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@feelings of a commander of a fine—what d’ye call ’em?—trireme in the
104@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@Mediterranean, ordered suddenly to the north; run overland across the Gauls in a
105@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@hurry; put in charge of one of these craft the legionaries—a wonderful lot of
106@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@handy men they must have been, too—used to build, apparently by the hundred, in
107@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@a month or two, if we may believe what we read. Imagine him here—the very end of
108@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@the world, a sea the colour of lead, a sky the colour of smoke, a kind of ship
109@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@about as rigid as a concertina—and going up this river with stores, or orders,
110@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@or what you like. Sand-banks, marshes, forests, savages,—precious little to eat
111@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@fit for a civilized man, nothing but Thames water to drink. No Falernian wine
112@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@here, no going ashore. Here and there a military camp lost in a wilderness, like
113@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@a needle in a bundle of hay—cold, fog, tempests, disease, exile, and death—death
114@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@skulking in the air, in the water, in the bush. They must have been dying like
115@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@flies here. Oh, yes—he did it. Did it very well, too, no doubt, and without
116@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@thinking much about it either, except afterwards to brag of what he had gone
117@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@through in his time, perhaps. They were men enough to face the darkness. And
118@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@perhaps he was cheered by keeping his eye on a chance of promotion to the fleet
119@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@at Ravenna by and by, if he had good friends in Rome and survived the awful
120@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@climate. Or think of a decent young citizen in a toga—perhaps too much dice, you
121@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@know—coming out here in the train of some prefect, or tax-gatherer, or trader
122@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@even, to mend his fortunes. Land in a swamp, march through the woods, and in
123@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@some inland post feel the savagery, the utter savagery, had closed round him—all
124@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@that mysterious life of the wilderness that stirs in the forest, in the jungles,
125@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@in the hearts of wild men. There’s no initiation either into such mysteries. He
126@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@has to live in the midst of the incomprehensible, which is also detestable. And
127@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@it has a fascination, too, that goes to work upon him.  The fascination of the
128@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@abomination—you know, imagine the growing regrets, the longing to escape, the
129@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@powerless disgust, the surrender, the hate.”
130@sl>Single Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@He paused.
131@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@“Mind,” he began again, lifting one arm from the elbow, the palm of the hand
132@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@outwards, so that, with his legs folded before him, he had the pose of a Buddha
133@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@preaching in European clothes and without a lotus-flower—“Mind, none of us would
134@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@feel exactly like this. What saves us is efficiency—the devotion to efficiency.
135@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@But these chaps were not much account, really. They were no colonists; their
136@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@administration was merely a squeeze, and nothing more, I suspect. They were
137@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@conquerors, and for that you want only brute force—nothing to boast of, when you
138@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@have it, since your strength is just an accident arising from the weakness of
139@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@others. They grabbed what they could get for the sake of what was to be got. It
140@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@was just robbery with violence, aggravated murder on a great scale, and men
141@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@going at it blind—as is very proper for those who tackle a darkness. The
142@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@conquest of the earth, which mostly means the taking it away from those who have
143@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@a different complexion or slightly flatter noses than ourselves, is not a pretty
144@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@thing when you look into it too much. What redeems it is the idea only. An idea
145@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@at the back of it; not a sentimental pretence but an idea; and an unselfish
146@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@belief in the idea—something you can set up, and bow down before, and offer a
147@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@sacrifice to....”
148@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@He broke off. Flames glided in the river, small green flames, red flames, white
149@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@flames, pursuing, overtaking, joining, crossing each other—then separating
150@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@slowly or hastily. The traffic of the great city went on in the deepening night
151@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@upon the sleepless river. We looked on, waiting patiently—there was nothing else
152@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@to do till the end of the flood; but it was only after a long silence, when he
153@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@said, in a hesitating voice, “I suppose you fellows remember I did once turn
154@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@fresh-water sailor for a bit,” that we knew we were fated, before the ebb began
155@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@to run, to hear about one of Marlow’s inconclusive experiences.
156@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@“I don’t want to bother you much with what happened to me personally,” he began,
157@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@showing in this remark the weakness of many tellers of tales who seem so often
158@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@unaware of what their audience would like best to hear; “yet to understand the
159@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@effect of it on me you ought to know how I got out there, what I saw, how I went
160@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@up that river to the place where I first met the poor chap. It was the farthest
161@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@point of navigation and the culminating point of my experience. It seemed
162@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@somehow to throw a kind of light on everything about me—and into my thoughts. It
163@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@was sombre enough, too—and pitiful—not extraordinary in any way—not very clear
164@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@either. No, not very clear. And yet it seemed to throw a kind of light.
165@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@“I had then, as you remember, just returned to London after a lot of Indian
166@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@Ocean, Pacific, China Seas—a regular dose of the East—six years or so, and I was
167@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@loafing about, hindering you fellows in your work and invading your homes, just
168@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@as though I had got a heavenly mission to civilize you. It was very fine for a
169@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@time, but after a bit I did get tired of resting. Then I began to look for a
170@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@ship—I should think the hardest work on earth. But the ships wouldn’t even look
171@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@at me. And I got tired of that game, too.
172@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@“Now when I was a little chap I had a passion for maps. I would look for hours
173@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@at South America, or Africa, or Australia, and lose myself in all the glories of
174@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@exploration. At that time there were many blank spaces on the earth, and when I
175@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@saw one that looked particularly inviting on a map (but they all look that) I
176@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@would put my finger on it and say, ‘When I grow up I will go there.’ The North
177@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@Pole was one of these places, I remember. Well, I haven’t been there yet, and
178@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@shall not try now. The glamour’s off. Other places were scattered about the
179@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@hemispheres. I have been in some of them, and... well, we won’t talk about that.
180@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@But there was one yet—the biggest, the most blank, so to speak—that I had a
181@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@hankering after.
182@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@“True, by this time it was not a blank space any more. It had got filled since
183@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@my boyhood with rivers and lakes and names. It had ceased to be a blank space of
184@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@delightful mystery—a white patch for a boy to dream gloriously over. It had
185@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@become a place of darkness. But there was in it one river especially, a mighty
186@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@big river, that you could see on the map, resembling an immense snake uncoiled,
187@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@with its head in the sea, its body at rest curving afar over a vast country, and
188@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@its tail lost in the depths of the land. And as I looked at the map of it in a
189@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@shop-window, it fascinated me as a snake would a bird—a silly little bird. Then
190@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@I remembered there was a big concern, a Company for trade on that river. Dash it
191@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@all! I thought to myself, they can’t trade without using some kind of craft on
192@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@that lot of fresh water—steamboats! Why shouldn’t I try to get charge of one? I
193@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@went on along Fleet Street, but could not shake off the idea. The snake had
194@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@charmed me.
195@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@“You understand it was a Continental concern, that Trading society; but I have a
196@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@lot of relations living on the Continent, because it’s cheap and not so nasty as
197@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@it looks, they say.
198@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@“I am sorry to own I began to worry them. This was already a fresh departure for
199@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@me. I was not used to get things that way, you know. I always went my own road
200@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@and on my own legs where I had a mind to go. I wouldn’t have believed it of
201@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@myself; but, then—you see—I felt somehow I must get there by hook or by crook.
202@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@So I worried them. The men said ’My dear fellow,’ and did nothing. Then—would
203@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@you believe it?—I tried the women. I, Charlie Marlow, set the women to work—to
204@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@get a job. Heavens! Well, you see, the notion drove me. I had an aunt, a dear
205@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@enthusiastic soul. She wrote: ‘It will be delightful. I am ready to do anything,
206@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@anything for you.  It is a glorious idea. I know the wife of a very high
207@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@personage in the Administration, and also a man who has lots of influence with,’
208@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@etc. She was determined to make no end of fuss to get me appointed skipper of a
209@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@river steamboat, if such was my fancy.
210@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@“I got my appointment—of course; and I got it very quick. It appears the Company
211@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@had received news that one of their captains had been killed in a scuffle with
212@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@the natives. This was my chance, and it made me the more anxious to go. It was
213@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@only months and months afterwards, when I made the attempt to recover what was
214@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@left of the body, that I heard the original quarrel arose from a
215@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@misunderstanding about some hens. Yes, two black hens.  Fresleven—that was the
216@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@fellow’s name, a Dane—thought himself wronged somehow in the bargain, so he went
217@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@ashore and started to hammer the chief of the village with a stick. Oh, it
218@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@didn’t surprise me in the least to hear this, and at the same time to be told
219@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@that Fresleven was the gentlest, quietest creature that ever walked on two legs.
220@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@No doubt he was; but he had been a couple of years already out there engaged in
221@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@the noble cause, you know, and he probably felt the need at last of asserting
222@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@his self-respect in some way. Therefore he whacked the old nigger mercilessly,
223@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@while a big crowd of his people watched him, thunderstruck, till some man—I was
224@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@told the chief’s son—in desperation at hearing the old chap yell, made a
225@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@tentative jab with a spear at the white man—and of course it went quite easy
226@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@between the shoulder-blades. Then the whole population cleared into the forest,
227@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@expecting all kinds of calamities to happen, while, on the other hand, the
228@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@steamer Fresleven commanded left also in a bad panic, in charge of the engineer,
229@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@I believe. Afterwards nobody seemed to trouble much about Fresleven’s remains,
230@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@till I got out and stepped into his shoes.  I couldn’t let it rest, though; but
231@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@when an opportunity offered at last to meet my predecessor, the grass growing
232@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@through his ribs was tall enough to hide his bones. They were all there. The
233@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@supernatural being had not been touched after he fell. And the village was
234@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@deserted, the huts gaped black, rotting, all askew within the fallen enclosures.
235@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@A calamity had come to it, sure enough. The people had vanished. Mad terror had
236@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@scattered them, men, women, and children, through the bush, and they had never
237@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@returned. What became of the hens I don’t know either. I should think the cause
238@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@of progress got them, anyhow. However, through this glorious affair I got my
239@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@appointment, before I had fairly begun to hope for it.
240@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@“I flew around like mad to get ready, and before forty-eight hours I was
241@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@crossing the Channel to show myself to my employers, and sign the contract.  In
242@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@a very few hours I arrived in a city that always makes me think of a whited
243@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@sepulchre. Prejudice no doubt. I had no difficulty in finding the Company’s
244@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@offices. It was the biggest thing in the town, and everybody I met was full of
245@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@it. They were going to run an over-sea empire, and make no end of coin by trade.
246@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@“A narrow and deserted street in deep shadow, high houses, innumerable windows
247@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@with venetian blinds, a dead silence, grass sprouting right and left, immense
248@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@double doors standing ponderously ajar. I slipped through one of these cracks,
249@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@went up a swept and ungarnished staircase, as arid as a desert, and opened the
250@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@first door I came to. Two women, one fat and the other slim, sat on
251@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@straw-bottomed chairs, knitting black wool. The slim one got up and walked
252@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@straight at me—still knitting with downcast eyes—and only just as I began to
253@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@think of getting out of her way, as you would for a somnambulist, stood still,
254@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@and looked up. Her dress was as plain as an umbrella-cover, and she turned round
255@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@without a word and preceded me into a waiting-room. I gave my name, and looked
256@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@about. Deal table in the middle, plain chairs all round the walls, on one end a
257@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@large shining map, marked with all the colours of a rainbow. There was a vast
258@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@amount of red—good to see at any time, because one knows that some real work is
259@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@done in there, a deuce of a lot of blue, a little green, smears of orange, and,
260@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@on the East Coast, a purple patch, to show where the jolly pioneers of progress
261@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@drink the jolly lager-beer. However, I wasn’t going into any of these.  I was
262@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@going into the yellow. Dead in the centre. And the river was
263@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@there—fascinating—deadly—like a snake. Ough! A door opened, a white-haired
264@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@secretarial head, but wearing a compassionate expression, appeared, and a skinny
265@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@forefinger beckoned me into the sanctuary. Its light was dim, and a heavy
266@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@writing-desk squatted in the middle. From behind that structure came out an
267@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@impression of pale plumpness in a frock-coat. The great man himself. He was five
268@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@feet six, I should judge, and had his grip on the handle-end of ever so many
269@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@millions. He shook hands, I fancy, murmured vaguely, was satisfied with my
270@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@French. _Bon Voyage_.
271@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@“In about forty-five seconds I found myself again in the waiting-room with the
272@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@compassionate secretary, who, full of desolation and sympathy, made me sign some
273@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@document. I believe I undertook amongst other things not to disclose any trade
274@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@secrets. Well, I am not going to.
275@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@“I began to feel slightly uneasy. You know I am not used to such ceremonies, and
276@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@there was something ominous in the atmosphere. It was just as though I had been
277@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@let into some conspiracy—I don’t know—something not quite right; and I was glad
278@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@to get out. In the outer room the two women knitted black wool feverishly.
279@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@People were arriving, and the younger one was walking back and forth introducing
280@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@them. The old one sat on her chair.  Her flat cloth slippers were propped up on
281@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@a foot-warmer, and a cat reposed on her lap. She wore a starched white affair on
282@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@her head, had a wart on one cheek, and silver-rimmed spectacles hung on the tip
283@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@of her nose. She glanced at me above the glasses. The swift and indifferent
284@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@placidity of that look troubled me. Two youths with foolish and cheery
285@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@countenances were being piloted over, and she threw at them the same quick
286@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@glance of unconcerned wisdom. She seemed to know all about them and about me,
287@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@too. An eerie feeling came over me. She seemed uncanny and fateful. Often far
288@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@away there I thought of these two, guarding the door of Darkness, knitting black
289@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@wool as for a warm pall, one introducing, introducing continuously to the
290@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@unknown, the other scrutinizing the cheery and foolish faces with unconcerned
291@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@old eyes. _Ave!_ Old knitter of black wool. _Morituri te salutant_. Not many of
292@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@those she looked at ever saw her again—not half, by a long way.
293@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@“There was yet a visit to the doctor. ‘A simple formality,’ assured me the
294@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@secretary, with an air of taking an immense part in all my sorrows.  Accordingly
295@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@a young chap wearing his hat over the left eyebrow, some clerk I suppose—there
296@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@must have been clerks in the business, though the house was as still as a house
297@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@in a city of the dead—came from somewhere up-stairs, and led me forth. He was
298@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@shabby and careless, with inkstains on the sleeves of his jacket, and his cravat
299@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@was large and billowy, under a chin shaped like the toe of an old boot. It was a
300@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@little too early for the doctor, so I proposed a drink, and thereupon he
301@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@developed a vein of joviality. As we sat over our vermouths he glorified the
302@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@Company’s business, and by and by I expressed casually my surprise at him not
303@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@going out there. He became very cool and collected all at once. ‘I am not such a
304@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@fool as I look, quoth Plato to his disciples,’ he said sententiously, emptied
305@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@his glass with great resolution, and we rose.
306@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@“The old doctor felt my pulse, evidently thinking of something else the while.
307@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@‘Good, good for there,’ he mumbled, and then with a certain eagerness asked me
308@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@whether I would let him measure my head. Rather surprised, I said Yes, when he
309@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@produced a thing like calipers and got the dimensions back and front and every
310@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@way, taking notes carefully. He was an unshaven little man in a threadbare coat
311@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@like a gaberdine, with his feet in slippers, and I thought him a harmless fool.
312@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@‘I always ask leave, in the interests of science, to measure the crania of those
313@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@going out there,’ he said. ‘And when they come back, too?’ I asked. ‘Oh, I never
314@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@see them,’ he remarked; ‘and, moreover, the changes take place inside, you
315@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@know.’ He smiled, as if at some quiet joke. ‘So you are going out there. Famous.
316@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@Interesting, too.’ He gave me a searching glance, and made another note.  ‘Ever
317@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@any madness in your family?’ he asked, in a matter-of-fact tone.  I felt very
318@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@annoyed. ‘Is that question in the interests of science, too?’ ‘It would be,’ he
319@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@said, without taking notice of my irritation, ‘interesting for science to watch
320@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@the mental changes of individuals, on the spot, but...’ ‘Are you an alienist?’ I
321@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@interrupted. ‘Every doctor should be—a little,’ answered that original,
322@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@imperturbably. ‘I have a little theory which you messieurs who go out there must
323@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@help me to prove. This is my share in the advantages my country shall reap from
324@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@the possession of such a magnificent dependency. The mere wealth I leave to
325@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@others. Pardon my questions, but you are the first Englishman coming under my
326@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@observation...’ I hastened to assure him I was not in the least typical. ’If I
327@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@were,’ said I, ‘I wouldn’t be talking like this with you.’ ‘What you say is
328@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@rather profound, and probably erroneous,’ he said, with a laugh. ‘Avoid
329@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@irritation more than exposure to the sun. _Adieu_. How do you English say, eh?
330@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@Good-bye. Ah! Good-bye. _Adieu_. In the tropics one must before everything keep
331@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@calm.’... He lifted a warning forefinger.... ’_Du calme, du calme_.’
332@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@“One thing more remained to do—say good-bye to my excellent aunt. I found her
333@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@triumphant. I had a cup of tea—the last decent cup of tea for many days—and in a
334@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@room that most soothingly looked just as you would expect a lady’s drawing-room
335@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@to look, we had a long quiet chat by the fireside. In the course of these
336@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@confidences it became quite plain to me I had been represented to the wife of
337@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@the high dignitary, and goodness knows to how many more people besides, as an
338@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@exceptional and gifted creature—a piece of good fortune for the Company—a man
339@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@you don’t get hold of every day. Good heavens! and I was going to take charge of
340@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@a two-penny-half-penny river-steamboat with a penny whistle attached! It
341@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@appeared, however, I was also one of the Workers, with a capital—you know.
342@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@Something like an emissary of light, something like a lower sort of apostle.
343@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@There had been a lot of such rot let loose in print and talk just about that
344@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@time, and the excellent woman, living right in the rush of all that humbug, got
345@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@carried off her feet. She talked about ‘weaning those ignorant millions from
346@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@their horrid ways,’ till, upon my word, she made me quite uncomfortable.  I
347@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@ventured to hint that the Company was run for profit.
348@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@“‘You forget, dear Charlie, that the labourer is worthy of his hire,’ she said,
349@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@brightly. It’s queer how out of touch with truth women are. They live in a world
350@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@of their own, and there has never been anything like it, and never can be. It is
351@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@too beautiful altogether, and if they were to set it up it would go to pieces
352@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@before the first sunset. Some confounded fact we men have been living
353@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@contentedly with ever since the day of creation would start up and knock the
354@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@whole thing over.
355@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@“After this I got embraced, told to wear flannel, be sure to write often, and so
356@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@on—and I left. In the street—I don’t know why—a queer feeling came to me that I
357@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@was an imposter. Odd thing that I, who used to clear out for any part of the
358@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@world at twenty-four hours’ notice, with less thought than most men give to the
359@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@crossing of a street, had a moment—I won’t say of hesitation, but of startled
360@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@pause, before this commonplace affair. The best way I can explain it to you is
361@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@by saying that, for a second or two, I felt as though, instead of going to the
362@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@centre of a continent, I were about to set off for the centre of the earth.
363@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@“I left in a French steamer, and she called in every blamed port they have out
364@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@there, for, as far as I could see, the sole purpose of landing soldiers and
365@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@custom-house officers. I watched the coast. Watching a coast as it slips by the
366@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@ship is like thinking about an enigma. There it is before you—smiling, frowning,
367@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@inviting, grand, mean, insipid, or savage, and always mute with an air of
368@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@whispering, ‘Come and find out.’ This one was almost featureless, as if still in
369@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@the making, with an aspect of monotonous grimness. The edge of a colossal
370@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@jungle, so dark-green as to be almost black, fringed with white surf, ran
371@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@straight, like a ruled line, far, far away along a blue sea whose glitter was
372@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@blurred by a creeping mist. The sun was fierce, the land seemed to glisten and
373@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@drip with steam. Here and there greyish-whitish specks showed up clustered
374@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@inside the white surf, with a flag flying above them perhaps. Settlements some
375@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@centuries old, and still no bigger than pinheads on the untouched expanse of
376@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@their background. We pounded along, stopped, landed soldiers; went on, landed
377@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@custom-house clerks to levy toll in what looked like a God-forsaken wilderness,
378@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@with a tin shed and a flag-pole lost in it; landed more soldiers—to take care of
379@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@the custom-house clerks, presumably. Some, I heard, got drowned in the surf; but
380@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@whether they did or not, nobody seemed particularly to care. They were just
381@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@flung out there, and on we went. Every day the coast looked the same, as though
382@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@we had not moved; but we passed various places—trading places—with names like
383@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@Gran’ Bassam, Little Popo; names that seemed to belong to some sordid farce
384@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@acted in front of a sinister back-cloth. The idleness of a passenger, my
385@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@isolation amongst all these men with whom I had no point of contact, the oily
386@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@and languid sea, the uniform sombreness of the coast, seemed to keep me away
387@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@from the truth of things, within the toil of a mournful and senseless delusion.
388@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@The voice of the surf heard now and then was a positive pleasure, like the
389@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@speech of a brother. It was something natural, that had its reason, that had a
390@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@meaning. Now and then a boat from the shore gave one a momentary contact with
391@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@reality. It was paddled by black fellows. You could see from afar the white of
392@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@their eyeballs glistening. They shouted, sang; their bodies streamed with
393@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@perspiration; they had faces like grotesque masks—these chaps; but they had
394@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@bone, muscle, a wild vitality, an intense energy of movement, that was as
395@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@natural and true as the surf along their coast. They wanted no excuse for being
396@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@there. They were a great comfort to look at. For a time I would feel I belonged
397@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@still to a world of straightforward facts; but the feeling would not last long.
398@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@Something would turn up to scare it away. Once, I remember, we came upon a
399@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@man-of-war anchored off the coast. There wasn’t even a shed there, and she was
400@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@shelling the bush. It appears the French had one of their wars going on
401@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@thereabouts. Her ensign dropped limp like a rag; the muzzles of the long
402@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@six-inch guns stuck out all over the low hull; the greasy, slimy swell swung her
403@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@up lazily and let her down, swaying her thin masts. In the empty immensity of
404@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@earth, sky, and water, there she was, incomprehensible, firing into a continent.
405@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@Pop, would go one of the six-inch guns; a small flame would dart and vanish, a
406@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@little white smoke would disappear, a tiny projectile would give a feeble
407@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@screech—and nothing happened. Nothing could happen. There was a touch of
408@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@insanity in the proceeding, a sense of lugubrious drollery in the sight; and it
409@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@was not dissipated by somebody on board assuring me earnestly there was a camp
410@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@of natives—he called them enemies!—hidden out of sight somewhere.
411@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@“We gave her her letters (I heard the men in that lonely ship were dying of
412@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@fever at the rate of three a day) and went on. We called at some more places
413@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@with farcical names, where the merry dance of death and trade goes on in a still
414@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@and earthy atmosphere as of an overheated catacomb; all along the formless coast
415@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@bordered by dangerous surf, as if Nature herself had tried to ward off
416@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@intruders; in and out of rivers, streams of death in life, whose banks were
417@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@rotting into mud, whose waters, thickened into slime, invaded the contorted
418@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@mangroves, that seemed to writhe at us in the extremity of an impotent despair.
419@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@Nowhere did we stop long enough to get a particularized impression, but the
420@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@general sense of vague and oppressive wonder grew upon me. It was like a weary
421@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@pilgrimage amongst hints for nightmares.
422@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@“It was upward of thirty days before I saw the mouth of the big river. We
423@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@anchored off the seat of the government. But my work would not begin till some
424@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@two hundred miles farther on. So as soon as I could I made a start for a place
425@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@thirty miles higher up.
426@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@“I had my passage on a little sea-going steamer. Her captain was a Swede, and
427@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@knowing me for a seaman, invited me on the bridge. He was a young man, lean,
428@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@fair, and morose, with lanky hair and a shuffling gait. As we left the miserable
429@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@little wharf, he tossed his head contemptuously at the shore.  ‘Been living
430@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@there?’ he asked. I said, ‘Yes.’ ‘Fine lot these government chaps—are they not?’
431@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@he went on, speaking English with great precision and considerable bitterness.
432@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@‘It is funny what some people will do for a few francs a month. I wonder what
433@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@becomes of that kind when it goes upcountry?’ I said to him I expected to see
434@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@that soon. ‘So-o-o!’ he exclaimed. He shuffled athwart, keeping one eye ahead
435@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@vigilantly. ‘Don’t be too sure,’ he continued. ‘The other day I took up a man
436@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@who hanged himself on the road.  He was a Swede, too.’ ’Hanged himself! Why, in
437@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@God’s name?’ I cried. He kept on looking out watchfully. ‘Who knows? The sun too
438@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@much for him, or the country perhaps.’
439@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@“At last we opened a reach. A rocky cliff appeared, mounds of turned-up earth by
440@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@the shore, houses on a hill, others with iron roofs, amongst a waste of
441@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@excavations, or hanging to the declivity. A continuous noise of the rapids above
442@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@hovered over this scene of inhabited devastation. A lot of people, mostly black
443@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@and naked, moved about like ants. A jetty projected into the river. A blinding
444@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@sunlight drowned all this at times in a sudden recrudescence of glare. ‘There’s
445@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@your Company’s station,’ said the Swede, pointing to three wooden barrack-like
446@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@structures on the rocky slope. ‘I will send your things up. Four boxes did you
447@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@say? So. Farewell.’
448@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@“I came upon a boiler wallowing in the grass, then found a path leading up the
449@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@hill. It turned aside for the boulders, and also for an undersized railway-truck
450@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@lying there on its back with its wheels in the air. One was off. The thing
451@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@looked as dead as the carcass of some animal. I came upon more pieces of
452@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@decaying machinery, a stack of rusty rails. To the left a clump of trees made a
453@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@shady spot, where dark things seemed to stir feebly. I blinked, the path was
454@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@steep. A horn tooted to the right, and I saw the black people run. A heavy and
455@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@dull detonation shook the ground, a puff of smoke came out of the cliff, and
456@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@that was all. No change appeared on the face of the rock. They were building a
457@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@railway. The cliff was not in the way or anything; but this objectless blasting
458@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@was all the work going on.
459@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@“A slight clinking behind me made me turn my head. Six black men advanced in a
460@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@file, toiling up the path. They walked erect and slow, balancing small baskets
461@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@full of earth on their heads, and the clink kept time with their footsteps.
462@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@Black rags were wound round their loins, and the short ends behind waggled to
463@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@and fro like tails. I could see every rib, the joints of their limbs were like
464@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@knots in a rope; each had an iron collar on his neck, and all were connected
465@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@together with a chain whose bights swung between them, rhythmically clinking.
466@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@Another report from the cliff made me think suddenly of that ship of war I had
467@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@seen firing into a continent. It was the same kind of ominous voice; but these
468@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@men could by no stretch of imagination be called enemies. They were called
469@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@criminals, and the outraged law, like the bursting shells, had come to them, an
470@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@insoluble mystery from the sea. All their meagre breasts panted together, the
471@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@violently dilated nostrils quivered, the eyes stared stonily uphill. They passed
472@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@me within six inches, without a glance, with that complete, deathlike
473@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@indifference of unhappy savages. Behind this raw matter one of the reclaimed,
474@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@the product of the new forces at work, strolled despondently, carrying a rifle
475@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@by its middle. He had a uniform jacket with one button off, and seeing a white
476@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@man on the path, hoisted his weapon to his shoulder with alacrity. This was
477@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@simple prudence, white men being so much alike at a distance that he could not
478@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@tell who I might be. He was speedily reassured, and with a large, white,
479@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@rascally grin, and a glance at his charge, seemed to take me into partnership in
480@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@his exalted trust. After all, I also was a part of the great cause of these high
481@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@and just proceedings.
482@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@“Instead of going up, I turned and descended to the left. My idea was to let
483@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@that chain-gang get out of sight before I climbed the hill. You know I am not
484@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@particularly tender; I’ve had to strike and to fend off. I’ve had to resist and
485@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@to attack sometimes—that’s only one way of resisting—without counting the exact
486@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@cost, according to the demands of such sort of life as I had blundered into.
487@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@I’ve seen the devil of violence, and the devil of greed, and the devil of hot
488@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@desire; but, by all the stars! these were strong, lusty, red-eyed devils, that
489@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@swayed and drove men—men, I tell you.  But as I stood on this hillside, I
490@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@foresaw that in the blinding sunshine of that land I would become acquainted
491@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@with a flabby, pretending, weak-eyed devil of a rapacious and pitiless folly.
492@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@How insidious he could be, too, I was only to find out several months later and
493@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@a thousand miles farther.  For a moment I stood appalled, as though by a
494@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@warning. Finally I descended the hill, obliquely, towards the trees I had seen.
495@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@“I avoided a vast artificial hole somebody had been digging on the slope, the
496@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@purpose of which I found it impossible to divine. It wasn’t a quarry or a
497@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@sandpit, anyhow. It was just a hole. It might have been connected with the
498@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@philanthropic desire of giving the criminals something to do. I don’t know. Then
499@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@I nearly fell into a very narrow ravine, almost no more than a scar in the
500@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@hillside. I discovered that a lot of imported drainage-pipes for the settlement
501@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@had been tumbled in there. There wasn’t one that was not broken. It was a wanton
502@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@smash-up. At last I got under the trees. My purpose was to stroll into the shade
503@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@for a moment; but no sooner within than it seemed to me I had stepped into the
504@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@gloomy circle of some Inferno.  The rapids were near, and an uninterrupted,
505@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@uniform, headlong, rushing noise filled the mournful stillness of the grove,
506@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@where not a breath stirred, not a leaf moved, with a mysterious sound—as though
507@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@the tearing pace of the launched earth had suddenly become audible.
508@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@“Black shapes crouched, lay, sat between the trees leaning against the trunks,
509@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@clinging to the earth, half coming out, half effaced within the dim light, in
510@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@all the attitudes of pain, abandonment, and despair. Another mine on the cliff
511@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@went off, followed by a slight shudder of the soil under my feet. The work was
512@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@going on. The work! And this was the place where some of the helpers had
513@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@withdrawn to die.
514@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@“They were dying slowly—it was very clear. They were not enemies, they were not
515@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@criminals, they were nothing earthly now—nothing but black shadows of disease
516@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@and starvation, lying confusedly in the greenish gloom. Brought from all the
517@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@recesses of the coast in all the legality of time contracts, lost in uncongenial
518@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@surroundings, fed on unfamiliar food, they sickened, became inefficient, and
519@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@were then allowed to crawl away and rest. These moribund shapes were free as
520@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@air—and nearly as thin. I began to distinguish the gleam of the eyes under the
521@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@trees. Then, glancing down, I saw a face near my hand. The black bones reclined
522@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@at full length with one shoulder against the tree, and slowly the eyelids rose
523@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@and the sunken eyes looked up at me, enormous and vacant, a kind of blind, white
524@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@flicker in the depths of the orbs, which died out slowly. The man seemed
525@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@young—almost a boy—but you know with them it’s hard to tell. I found nothing
526@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@else to do but to offer him one of my good Swede’s ship’s biscuits I had in my
527@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@pocket. The fingers closed slowly on it and held—there was no other movement and
528@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@no other glance. He had tied a bit of white worsted round his neck—Why? Where
529@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@did he get it? Was it a badge—an ornament—a charm—a propitiatory act? Was there
530@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@any idea at all connected with it? It looked startling round his black neck,
531@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@this bit of white thread from beyond the seas.
532@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@“Near the same tree two more bundles of acute angles sat with their legs drawn
533@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@up. One, with his chin propped on his knees, stared at nothing, in an
534@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@intolerable and appalling manner: his brother phantom rested its forehead, as if
535@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@overcome with a great weariness; and all about others were scattered in every
536@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@pose of contorted collapse, as in some picture of a massacre or a pestilence.
537@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@While I stood horror-struck, one of these creatures rose to his hands and knees,
538@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@and went off on all-fours towards the river to drink.  He lapped out of his
539@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@hand, then sat up in the sunlight, crossing his shins in front of him, and after
540@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@a time let his woolly head fall on his breastbone.
541@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@“I didn’t want any more loitering in the shade, and I made haste towards the
542@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@station. When near the buildings I met a white man, in such an unexpected
543@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@elegance of get-up that in the first moment I took him for a sort of vision. I
544@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@saw a high starched collar, white cuffs, a light alpaca jacket, snowy trousers,
545@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@a clean necktie, and varnished boots. No hat. Hair parted, brushed, oiled, under
546@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@a green-lined parasol held in a big white hand. He was amazing, and had a
547@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@penholder behind his ear.
548@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@“I shook hands with this miracle, and I learned he was the Company’s chief
549@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@accountant, and that all the book-keeping was done at this station. He had come
550@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@out for a moment, he said, ‘to get a breath of fresh air. The expression sounded
551@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@wonderfully odd, with its suggestion of sedentary desk-life. I wouldn’t have
552@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@mentioned the fellow to you at all, only it was from his lips that I first heard
553@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@the name of the man who is so indissolubly connected with the memories of that
554@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@time. Moreover, I respected the fellow. Yes; I respected his collars, his vast
555@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@cuffs, his brushed hair. His appearance was certainly that of a hairdresser’s
556@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@dummy; but in the great demoralization of the land he kept up his appearance.
557@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@That’s backbone. His starched collars and got-up shirt-fronts were achievements
558@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@of character. He had been out nearly three years; and, later, I could not help
559@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@asking him how he managed to sport such linen. He had just the faintest blush,
560@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@and said modestly, ’I’ve been teaching one of the native women about the
561@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@station. It was difficult. She had a distaste for the work.’ Thus this man had
562@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@verily accomplished something. And he was devoted to his books, which were in
563@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@apple-pie order.
564@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@“Everything else in the station was in a muddle—heads, things, buildings.
565@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@Strings of dusty niggers with splay feet arrived and departed; a stream of
566@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@manufactured goods, rubbishy cottons, beads, and brass-wire sent into the depths
567@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@of darkness, and in return came a precious trickle of ivory.
568@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@“I had to wait in the station for ten days—an eternity. I lived in a hut in the
569@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@yard, but to be out of the chaos I would sometimes get into the accountant’s
570@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@office. It was built of horizontal planks, and so badly put together that, as he
571@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@bent over his high desk, he was barred from neck to heels with narrow strips of
572@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@sunlight. There was no need to open the big shutter to see. It was hot there,
573@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@too; big flies buzzed fiendishly, and did not sting, but stabbed. I sat
574@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@generally on the floor, while, of faultless appearance (and even slightly
575@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@scented), perching on a high stool, he wrote, he wrote. Sometimes he stood up
576@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@for exercise. When a truckle-bed with a sick man (some invalid agent from
577@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@upcountry) was put in there, he exhibited a gentle annoyance. ‘The groans of
578@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@this sick person,’ he said, ‘distract my attention. And without that it is
579@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@extremely difficult to guard against clerical errors in this climate.’
580@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@“One day he remarked, without lifting his head, ‘In the interior you will no
581@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@doubt meet Mr. Kurtz.’ On my asking who Mr. Kurtz was, he said he was a
582@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@first-class agent; and seeing my disappointment at this information, he added
583@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@slowly, laying down his pen, ‘He is a very remarkable person.’ Further questions
584@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@elicited from him that Mr. Kurtz was at present in charge of a trading-post, a
585@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@very important one, in the true ivory-country, at ‘the very bottom of there.
586@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@Sends in as much ivory as all the others put together...’ He began to write
587@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@again. The sick man was too ill to groan.  The flies buzzed in a great peace.
588@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@“Suddenly there was a growing murmur of voices and a great tramping of feet. A
589@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@caravan had come in. A violent babble of uncouth sounds burst out on the other
590@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@side of the planks. All the carriers were speaking together, and in the midst of
591@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@the uproar the lamentable voice of the chief agent was heard ‘giving it up’
592@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@tearfully for the twentieth time that day.... He rose slowly. ‘What a frightful
593@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@row,’ he said. He crossed the room gently to look at the sick man, and
594@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@returning, said to me, ‘He does not hear.’ ‘What!  Dead?’ I asked, startled.
595@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@‘No, not yet,’ he answered, with great composure.  Then, alluding with a toss of
596@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@the head to the tumult in the station-yard, ‘When one has got to make correct
597@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@entries, one comes to hate those savages—hate them to the death.’ He remained
598@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@thoughtful for a moment. ‘When you see Mr. Kurtz’ he went on, ‘tell him from me
599@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@that everything here’—he glanced at the deck—’ is very satisfactory. I don’t
600@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@like to write to him—with those messengers of ours you never know who may get
601@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@hold of your letter—at that Central Station.’ He stared at me for a moment with
602@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@his mild, bulging eyes. ‘Oh, he will go far, very far,’ he began again. ‘He will
603@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@be a somebody in the Administration before long. They, above—the Council in
604@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@Europe, you know—mean him to be.’
605@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@“He turned to his work. The noise outside had ceased, and presently in going out
606@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@I stopped at the door. In the steady buzz of flies the homeward-bound agent was
607@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@lying finished and insensible; the other, bent over his books, was making
608@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@correct entries of perfectly correct transactions; and fifty feet below the
609@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@doorstep I could see the still tree-tops of the grove of death.
610@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@“Next day I left that station at last, with a caravan of sixty men, for a
611@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@two-hundred-mile tramp.
612@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@“No use telling you much about that. Paths, paths, everywhere; a stamped-in
613@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@network of paths spreading over the empty land, through the long grass, through
614@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@burnt grass, through thickets, down and up chilly ravines, up and down stony
615@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@hills ablaze with heat; and a solitude, a solitude, nobody, not a hut. The
616@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@population had cleared out a long time ago. Well, if a lot of mysterious niggers
617@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@armed with all kinds of fearful weapons suddenly took to travelling on the road
618@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@between Deal and Gravesend, catching the yokels right and left to carry heavy
619@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@loads for them, I fancy every farm and cottage thereabouts would get empty very
620@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@soon. Only here the dwellings were gone, too. Still I passed through several
621@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@abandoned villages. There’s something pathetically childish in the ruins of
622@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@grass walls. Day after day, with the stamp and shuffle of sixty pair of bare
623@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@feet behind me, each pair under a 60-lb. load. Camp, cook, sleep, strike camp,
624@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@march. Now and then a carrier dead in harness, at rest in the long grass near
625@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@the path, with an empty water-gourd and his long staff lying by his side. A
626@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@great silence around and above. Perhaps on some quiet night the tremor of
627@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@far-off drums, sinking, swelling, a tremor vast, faint; a sound weird,
628@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@appealing, suggestive, and wild—and perhaps with as profound a meaning as the
629@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@sound of bells in a Christian country. Once a white man in an unbuttoned
630@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@uniform, camping on the path with an armed escort of lank Zanzibaris, very
631@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@hospitable and festive—not to say drunk. Was looking after the upkeep of the
632@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@road, he declared. Can’t say I saw any road or any upkeep, unless the body of a
633@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@middle-aged negro, with a bullet-hole in the forehead, upon which I absolutely
634@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@stumbled three miles farther on, may be considered as a permanent improvement. I
635@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@had a white companion, too, not a bad chap, but rather too fleshy and with the
636@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@exasperating habit of fainting on the hot hillsides, miles away from the least
637@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@bit of shade and water. Annoying, you know, to hold your own coat like a parasol
638@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@over a man’s head while he is coming to. I couldn’t help asking him once what he
639@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@meant by coming there at all. ‘To make money, of course. What do you think?’ he
640@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@said, scornfully.  Then he got fever, and had to be carried in a hammock slung
641@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@under a pole.  As he weighed sixteen stone I had no end of rows with the
642@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@carriers. They jibbed, ran away, sneaked off with their loads in the night—quite
643@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@a mutiny.  So, one evening, I made a speech in English with gestures, not one of
644@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@which was lost to the sixty pairs of eyes before me, and the next morning I
645@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@started the hammock off in front all right. An hour afterwards I came upon the
646@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@whole concern wrecked in a bush—man, hammock, groans, blankets, horrors. The
647@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@heavy pole had skinned his poor nose. He was very anxious for me to kill
648@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@somebody, but there wasn’t the shadow of a carrier near.  I remembered the old
649@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@doctor—‘It would be interesting for science to watch the mental changes of
650@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@individuals, on the spot.’ I felt I was becoming scientifically interesting.
651@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@However, all that is to no purpose. On the fifteenth day I came in sight of the
652@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@big river again, and hobbled into the Central Station. It was on a back water
653@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@surrounded by scrub and forest, with a pretty border of smelly mud on one side,
654@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@and on the three others enclosed by a crazy fence of rushes. A neglected gap was
655@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@all the gate it had, and the first glance at the place was enough to let you see
656@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@the flabby devil was running that show. White men with long staves in their
657@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@hands appeared languidly from amongst the buildings, strolling up to take a look
658@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@at me, and then retired out of sight somewhere. One of them, a stout, excitable
659@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@chap with black moustaches, informed me with great volubility and many
660@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@digressions, as soon as I told him who I was, that my steamer was at the bottom
661@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@of the river. I was thunderstruck. What, how, why? Oh, it was ‘all right.’ The
662@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@‘manager himself’ was there. All quite correct. ‘Everybody had behaved
663@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@splendidly! splendidly!’—‘you must,’ he said in agitation, ‘go and see the
664@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@general manager at once. He is waiting!’
665@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@“I did not see the real significance of that wreck at once. I fancy I see it
666@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@now, but I am not sure—not at all. Certainly the affair was too stupid—when I
667@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@think of it—to be altogether natural. Still... But at the moment it presented
668@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@itself simply as a confounded nuisance. The steamer was sunk. They had started
669@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@two days before in a sudden hurry up the river with the manager on board, in
670@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@charge of some volunteer skipper, and before they had been out three hours they
671@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@tore the bottom out of her on stones, and she sank near the south bank. I asked
672@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@myself what I was to do there, now my boat was lost. As a matter of fact, I had
673@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@plenty to do in fishing my command out of the river. I had to set about it the
674@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@very next day. That, and the repairs when I brought the pieces to the station,
675@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@took some months.
676@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@“My first interview with the manager was curious. He did not ask me to sit down
677@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@after my twenty-mile walk that morning. He was commonplace in complexion, in
678@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@features, in manners, and in voice. He was of middle size and of ordinary build.
679@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@His eyes, of the usual blue, were perhaps remarkably cold, and he certainly
680@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@could make his glance fall on one as trenchant and heavy as an axe. But even at
681@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@these times the rest of his person seemed to disclaim the intention. Otherwise
682@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@there was only an indefinable, faint expression of his lips, something
683@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@stealthy—a smile—not a smile—I remember it, but I can’t explain. It was
684@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@unconscious, this smile was, though just after he had said something it got
685@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@intensified for an instant. It came at the end of his speeches like a seal
686@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@applied on the words to make the meaning of the commonest phrase appear
687@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@absolutely inscrutable. He was a common trader, from his youth up employed in
688@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@these parts—nothing more. He was obeyed, yet he inspired neither love nor fear,
689@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@nor even respect. He inspired uneasiness. That was it! Uneasiness. Not a
690@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@definite mistrust—just uneasiness—nothing more. You have no idea how effective
691@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@such a... a...  faculty can be. He had no genius for organizing, for initiative,
692@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@or for order even. That was evident in such things as the deplorable state of
693@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@the station. He had no learning, and no intelligence. His position had come to
694@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@him—why? Perhaps because he was never ill... He had served three terms of three
695@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@years out there... Because triumphant health in the general rout of
696@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@constitutions is a kind of power in itself. When he went home on leave he rioted
697@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@on a large scale—pompously. Jack ashore—with a difference—in externals only.
698@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@This one could gather from his casual talk. He originated nothing, he could keep
699@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@the routine going—that’s all. But he was great. He was great by this little
700@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@thing that it was impossible to tell what could control such a man. He never
701@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@gave that secret away. Perhaps there was nothing within him. Such a suspicion
702@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@made one pause—for out there there were no external checks. Once when various
703@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@tropical diseases had laid low almost every ‘agent’ in the station, he was heard
704@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@to say, ‘Men who come out here should have no entrails.’ He sealed the utterance
705@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@with that smile of his, as though it had been a door opening into a darkness he
706@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@had in his keeping. You fancied you had seen things—but the seal was on. When
707@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@annoyed at meal-times by the constant quarrels of the white men about
708@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@precedence, he ordered an immense round table to be made, for which a special
709@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@house had to be built. This was the station’s mess-room. Where he sat was the
710@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@first place—the rest were nowhere. One felt this to be his unalterable
711@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@conviction. He was neither civil nor uncivil. He was quiet. He allowed his
712@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@‘boy’—an overfed young negro from the coast—to treat the white men, under his
713@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@very eyes, with provoking insolence.
714@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@“He began to speak as soon as he saw me. I had been very long on the road.  He
715@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@could not wait. Had to start without me. The up-river stations had to be
716@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@relieved. There had been so many delays already that he did not know who was
717@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@dead and who was alive, and how they got on—and so on, and so on. He paid no
718@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@attention to my explanations, and, playing with a stick of sealing-wax, repeated
719@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@several times that the situation was ’very grave, very grave.’ There were
720@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@rumours that a very important station was in jeopardy, and its chief, Mr. Kurtz,
721@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@was ill. Hoped it was not true. Mr.  Kurtz was... I felt weary and irritable.
722@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@Hang Kurtz, I thought.  I interrupted him by saying I had heard of Mr. Kurtz on
723@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@the coast. ‘Ah! So they talk of him down there,’ he murmured to himself. Then he
724@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@began again, assuring me Mr. Kurtz was the best agent he had, an exceptional
725@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@man, of the greatest importance to the Company; therefore I could understand his
726@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@anxiety. He was, he said, ‘very, very uneasy.’ Certainly he fidgeted on his
727@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@chair a good deal, exclaimed, ‘Ah, Mr. Kurtz!’ broke the stick of sealing-wax
728@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@and seemed dumfounded by the accident. Next thing he wanted to know ‘how long it
729@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@would take to’... I interrupted him again. Being hungry, you know, and kept on
730@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@my feet too. I was getting savage. ‘How can I tell?’ I said. ‘I haven’t even
731@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@seen the wreck yet—some months, no doubt.’ All this talk seemed to me so futile.
732@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@‘Some months,’ he said. ‘Well, let us say three months before we can make a
733@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@start. Yes. That ought to do the affair.’ I flung out of his hut (he lived all
734@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@alone in a clay hut with a sort of verandah) muttering to myself my opinion of
735@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@him. He was a chattering idiot.  Afterwards I took it back when it was borne in
736@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@upon me startlingly with what extreme nicety he had estimated the time requisite
737@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@for the ’affair.’
738@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@“I went to work the next day, turning, so to speak, my back on that station. In
739@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@that way only it seemed to me I could keep my hold on the redeeming facts of
740@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@life. Still, one must look about sometimes; and then I saw this station, these
741@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@men strolling aimlessly about in the sunshine of the yard. I asked myself
742@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@sometimes what it all meant. They wandered here and there with their absurd long
743@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@staves in their hands, like a lot of faithless pilgrims bewitched inside a
744@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@rotten fence. The word ‘ivory’ rang in the air, was whispered, was sighed. You
745@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@would think they were praying to it. A taint of imbecile rapacity blew through
746@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@it all, like a whiff from some corpse. By Jove! I’ve never seen anything so
747@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@unreal in my life. And outside, the silent wilderness surrounding this cleared
748@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@speck on the earth struck me as something great and invincible, like evil or
749@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@truth, waiting patiently for the passing away of this fantastic invasion.
750@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@“Oh, these months! Well, never mind. Various things happened. One evening a
751@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@grass shed full of calico, cotton prints, beads, and I don’t know what else,
752@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@burst into a blaze so suddenly that you would have thought the earth had opened
753@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@to let an avenging fire consume all that trash. I was smoking my pipe quietly by
754@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@my dismantled steamer, and saw them all cutting capers in the light, with their
755@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@arms lifted high, when the stout man with moustaches came tearing down to the
756@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@river, a tin pail in his hand, assured me that everybody was ‘behaving
757@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@splendidly, splendidly,’ dipped about a quart of water and tore back again. I
758@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@noticed there was a hole in the bottom of his pail.
759@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@“I strolled up. There was no hurry. You see the thing had gone off like a box of
760@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@matches. It had been hopeless from the very first. The flame had leaped high,
761@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@driven everybody back, lighted up everything—and collapsed.  The shed was
762@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@already a heap of embers glowing fiercely. A nigger was being beaten near by.
763@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@They said he had caused the fire in some way; be that as it may, he was
764@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@screeching most horribly. I saw him, later, for several days, sitting in a bit
765@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@of shade looking very sick and trying to recover himself; afterwards he arose
766@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@and went out—and the wilderness without a sound took him into its bosom again.
767@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@As I approached the glow from the dark I found myself at the back of two men,
768@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@talking. I heard the name of Kurtz pronounced, then the words, ‘take advantage
769@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@of this unfortunate accident.’ One of the men was the manager. I wished him a
770@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@good evening. ‘Did you ever see anything like it—eh? it is incredible,’ he said,
771@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@and walked off. The other man remained. He was a first-class agent, young,
772@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@gentlemanly, a bit reserved, with a forked little beard and a hooked nose. He
773@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@was stand-offish with the other agents, and they on their side said he was the
774@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@manager’s spy upon them. As to me, I had hardly ever spoken to him before. We
775@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@got into talk, and by and by we strolled away from the hissing ruins. Then he
776@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@asked me to his room, which was in the main building of the station. He struck a
777@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@match, and I perceived that this young aristocrat had not only a silver-mounted
778@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@dressing-case but also a whole candle all to himself.  Just at that time the
779@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@manager was the only man supposed to have any right to candles. Native mats
780@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@covered the clay walls; a collection of spears, assegais, shields, knives was
781@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@hung up in trophies. The business intrusted to this fellow was the making of
782@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@bricks—so I had been informed; but there wasn’t a fragment of a brick anywhere
783@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@in the station, and he had been there more than a year—waiting. It seems he
784@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@could not make bricks without something, I don’t know what—straw maybe. Anyway,
785@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@it could not be found there and as it was not likely to be sent from Europe, it
786@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@did not appear clear to me what he was waiting for. An act of special creation
787@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@perhaps.  However, they were all waiting—all the sixteen or twenty pilgrims of
788@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@them—for something; and upon my word it did not seem an uncongenial occupation,
789@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@from the way they took it, though the only thing that ever came to them was
790@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@disease—as far as I could see. They beguiled the time by back-biting and
791@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@intriguing against each other in a foolish kind of way.  There was an air of
792@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@plotting about that station, but nothing came of it, of course. It was as unreal
793@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@as everything else—as the philanthropic pretence of the whole concern, as their
794@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@talk, as their government, as their show of work. The only real feeling was a
795@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@desire to get appointed to a trading-post where ivory was to be had, so that
796@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@they could earn percentages. They intrigued and slandered and hated each other
797@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@only on that account—but as to effectually lifting a little finger—oh, no. By
798@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@heavens! there is something after all in the world allowing one man to steal a
799@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@horse while another must not look at a halter. Steal a horse straight out. Very
800@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@well. He has done it. Perhaps he can ride. But there is a way of looking at a
801@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@halter that would provoke the most charitable of saints into a kick.
802@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@“I had no idea why he wanted to be sociable, but as we chatted in there it
803@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@suddenly occurred to me the fellow was trying to get at something—in fact,
804@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@pumping me. He alluded constantly to Europe, to the people I was supposed to
805@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@know there—putting leading questions as to my acquaintances in the sepulchral
806@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@city, and so on. His little eyes glittered like mica discs—with curiosity—though
807@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@he tried to keep up a bit of superciliousness. At first I was astonished, but
808@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@very soon I became awfully curious to see what he would find out from me. I
809@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@couldn’t possibly imagine what I had in me to make it worth his while. It was
810@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@very pretty to see how he baffled himself, for in truth my body was full only of
811@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@chills, and my head had nothing in it but that wretched steamboat business. It
812@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@was evident he took me for a perfectly shameless prevaricator. At last he got
813@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@angry, and, to conceal a movement of furious annoyance, he yawned. I rose. Then
814@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@I noticed a small sketch in oils, on a panel, representing a woman, draped and
815@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@blindfolded, carrying a lighted torch. The background was sombre—almost black.
816@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@The movement of the woman was stately, and the effect of the torchlight on the
817@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@face was sinister.
818@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@“It arrested me, and he stood by civilly, holding an empty half-pint champagne
819@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@bottle (medical comforts) with the candle stuck in it. To my question he said
820@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@Mr. Kurtz had painted this—in this very station more than a year ago—while
821@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@waiting for means to go to his trading post. ’Tell me, pray,’ said I, ‘who is
822@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@this Mr. Kurtz?’
823@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@“‘The chief of the Inner Station,’ he answered in a short tone, looking away.
824@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@‘Much obliged,’ I said, laughing. ‘And you are the brickmaker of the Central
825@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@Station. Every one knows that.’ He was silent for a while. ’He is a prodigy,’ he
826@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@said at last. ‘He is an emissary of pity and science and progress, and devil
827@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@knows what else. We want,’ he began to declaim suddenly, ‘for the guidance of
828@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@the cause intrusted to us by Europe, so to speak, higher intelligence, wide
829@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@sympathies, a singleness of purpose.’ ‘Who says that?’ I asked. ‘Lots of them,’
830@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@he replied. ‘Some even write that; and so _he_ comes here, a special being, as
831@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@you ought to know.’ ‘Why ought I to know?’ I interrupted, really surprised. He
832@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@paid no attention. ‘Yes. Today he is chief of the best station, next year he
833@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@will be assistant-manager, two years more and... but I dare-say you know what he
834@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@will be in two years’ time. You are of the new gang—the gang of virtue. The same
835@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@people who sent him specially also recommended you. Oh, don’t say no. I’ve my
836@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@own eyes to trust.’ Light dawned upon me. My dear aunt’s influential
837@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@acquaintances were producing an unexpected effect upon that young man. I nearly
838@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@burst into a laugh. ‘Do you read the Company’s confidential correspondence?’ I
839@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@asked. He hadn’t a word to say. It was great fun. ‘When Mr. Kurtz,’ I continued,
840@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@severely, ‘is General Manager, you won’t have the opportunity.’
841@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@“He blew the candle out suddenly, and we went outside. The moon had risen.
842@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@Black figures strolled about listlessly, pouring water on the glow, whence
843@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@proceeded a sound of hissing; steam ascended in the moonlight, the beaten nigger
844@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@groaned somewhere. ‘What a row the brute makes!’ said the indefatigable man with
845@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@the moustaches, appearing near us. ‘Serve him right.
846@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@Transgression—punishment—bang! Pitiless, pitiless. That’s the only way.  This
847@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@will prevent all conflagrations for the future. I was just telling the
848@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@manager...’ He noticed my companion, and became crestfallen all at once.  ‘Not
849@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@in bed yet,’ he said, with a kind of servile heartiness; ‘it’s so natural. Ha!
850@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@Danger—agitation.’ He vanished. I went on to the riverside, and the other
851@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@followed me. I heard a scathing murmur at my ear, ‘Heap of muffs—go to.’ The
852@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@pilgrims could be seen in knots gesticulating, discussing. Several had still
853@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@their staves in their hands. I verily believe they took these sticks to bed with
854@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@them. Beyond the fence the forest stood up spectrally in the moonlight, and
855@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@through that dim stir, through the faint sounds of that lamentable courtyard,
856@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@the silence of the land went home to one’s very heart—its mystery, its
857@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@greatness, the amazing reality of its concealed life. The hurt nigger moaned
858@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@feebly somewhere near by, and then fetched a deep sigh that made me mend my pace
859@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@away from there. I felt a hand introducing itself under my arm. ’My dear sir,’
860@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@said the fellow, ‘I don’t want to be misunderstood, and especially by you, who
861@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@will see Mr.  Kurtz long before I can have that pleasure. I wouldn’t like him to
862@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@get a false idea of my disposition....’
863@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@“I let him run on, this _papier-mache_ Mephistopheles, and it seemed to me that
864@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@if I tried I could poke my forefinger through him, and would find nothing inside
865@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@but a little loose dirt, maybe. He, don’t you see, had been planning to be
866@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@assistant-manager by and by under the present man, and I could see that the
867@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@coming of that Kurtz had upset them both not a little.  He talked precipitately,
868@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@and I did not try to stop him. I had my shoulders against the wreck of my
869@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@steamer, hauled up on the slope like a carcass of some big river animal. The
870@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@smell of mud, of primeval mud, by Jove! was in my nostrils, the high stillness
871@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@of primeval forest was before my eyes; there were shiny patches on the black
872@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@creek. The moon had spread over everything a thin layer of silver—over the rank
873@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@grass, over the mud, upon the wall of matted vegetation standing higher than the
874@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@wall of a temple, over the great river I could see through a sombre gap
875@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@glittering, glittering, as it flowed broadly by without a murmur. All this was
876@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@great, expectant, mute, while the man jabbered about himself. I wondered whether
877@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@the stillness on the face of the immensity looking at us two were meant as an
878@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@appeal or as a menace. What were we who had strayed in here? Could we handle
879@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@that dumb thing, or would it handle us? I felt how big, how confoundedly big,
880@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@was that thing that couldn’t talk, and perhaps was deaf as well. What was in
881@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@there? I could see a little ivory coming out from there, and I had heard Mr.
882@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@Kurtz was in there. I had heard enough about it, too—God knows! Yet somehow it
883@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@didn’t bring any image with it—no more than if I had been told an angel or a
884@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@fiend was in there. I believed it in the same way one of you might believe there
885@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@are inhabitants in the planet Mars.  I knew once a Scotch sailmaker who was
886@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@certain, dead sure, there were people in Mars. If you asked him for some idea
887@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@how they looked and behaved, he would get shy and mutter something about
888@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@‘walking on all-fours.’ If you as much as smiled, he would—though a man of
889@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@sixty—offer to fight you. I would not have gone so far as to fight for Kurtz,
890@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@but I went for him near enough to a lie. You know I hate, detest, and can’t bear
891@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@a lie, not because I am straighter than the rest of us, but simply because it
892@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@appalls me. There is a taint of death, a flavour of mortality in lies—which is
893@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@exactly what I hate and detest in the world—what I want to forget. It makes me
894@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@miserable and sick, like biting something rotten would do. Temperament, I
895@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@suppose. Well, I went near enough to it by letting the young fool there believe
896@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@anything he liked to imagine as to my influence in Europe. I became in an
897@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@instant as much of a pretence as the rest of the bewitched pilgrims. This simply
898@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@because I had a notion it somehow would be of help to that Kurtz whom at the
899@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@time I did not see—you understand. He was just a word for me. I did not see the
900@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@man in the name any more than you do.  Do you see him? Do you see the story? Do
901@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@you see anything? It seems to me I am trying to tell you a dream—making a vain
902@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@attempt, because no relation of a dream can convey the dream-sensation, that
903@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@commingling of absurdity, surprise, and bewilderment in a tremor of struggling
904@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@revolt, that notion of being captured by the incredible which is of the very
905@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@essence of dreams....”
906@sl>Single Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@He was silent for a while.
907@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@“... No, it is impossible; it is impossible to convey the life-sensation of any
908@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@given epoch of one’s existence—that which makes its truth, its meaning—its
909@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@subtle and penetrating essence. It is impossible. We live, as we
910@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@dream—alone....”
911@sl>Single Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@He paused again as if reflecting, then added:
912@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@“Of course in this you fellows see more than I could then. You see me, whom you
913@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@know....”
914@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@It had become so pitch dark that we listeners could hardly see one another.  For
915@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@a long time already he, sitting apart, had been no more to us than a voice.
916@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@There was not a word from anybody. The others might have been asleep, but I was
917@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@awake. I listened, I listened on the watch for the sentence, for the word, that
918@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@would give me the clue to the faint uneasiness inspired by this narrative that
919@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@seemed to shape itself without human lips in the heavy night-air of the river.
920@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@“... Yes—I let him run on,” Marlow began again, “and think what he pleased about
921@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@the powers that were behind me. I did! And there was nothing behind me! There
922@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@was nothing but that wretched, old, mangled steamboat I was leaning against,
923@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@while he talked fluently about ‘the necessity for every man to get on.’ ‘And
924@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@when one comes out here, you conceive, it is not to gaze at the moon.’ Mr. Kurtz
925@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@was a ‘universal genius,’ but even a genius would find it easier to work with
926@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@‘adequate tools—intelligent men.’ He did not make bricks—why, there was a
927@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@physical impossibility in the way—as I was well aware; and if he did secretarial
928@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@work for the manager, it was because ‘no sensible man rejects wantonly the
929@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@confidence of his superiors.’ Did I see it? I saw it. What more did I want? What
930@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@I really wanted was rivets, by heaven! Rivets. To get on with the work—to stop
931@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@the hole. Rivets I wanted. There were cases of them down at the
932@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@coast—cases—piled up—burst—split! You kicked a loose rivet at every second step
933@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@in that station-yard on the hillside. Rivets had rolled into the grove of death.
934@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@You could fill your pockets with rivets for the trouble of stooping down—and
935@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@there wasn’t one rivet to be found where it was wanted. We had plates that would
936@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@do, but nothing to fasten them with. And every week the messenger, a long negro,
937@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@letter-bag on shoulder and staff in hand, left our station for the coast. And
938@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@several times a week a coast caravan came in with trade goods—ghastly glazed
939@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@calico that made you shudder only to look at it, glass beads value about a penny
940@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@a quart, confounded spotted cotton handkerchiefs. And no rivets. Three carriers
941@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@could have brought all that was wanted to set that steamboat afloat.
942@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@“He was becoming confidential now, but I fancy my unresponsive attitude must
943@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@have exasperated him at last, for he judged it necessary to inform me he feared
944@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@neither God nor devil, let alone any mere man. I said I could see that very
945@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@well, but what I wanted was a certain quantity of rivets—and rivets were what
946@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@really Mr. Kurtz wanted, if he had only known it. Now letters went to the coast
947@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@every week.... ‘My dear sir,’ he cried, ‘I write from dictation.’ I demanded
948@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@rivets. There was a way—for an intelligent man.  He changed his manner; became
949@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@very cold, and suddenly began to talk about a hippopotamus; wondered whether
950@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@sleeping on board the steamer (I stuck to my salvage night and day) I wasn’t
951@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@disturbed. There was an old hippo that had the bad habit of getting out on the
952@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@bank and roaming at night over the station grounds. The pilgrims used to turn
953@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@out in a body and empty every rifle they could lay hands on at him. Some even
954@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@had sat up o’ nights for him. All this energy was wasted, though. ‘That animal
955@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@has a charmed life,’ he said; ’but you can say this only of brutes in this
956@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@country. No man—you apprehend me?—no man here bears a charmed life.’ He stood
957@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@there for a moment in the moonlight with his delicate hooked nose set a little
958@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@askew, and his mica eyes glittering without a wink, then, with a curt
959@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@Good-night, he strode off. I could see he was disturbed and considerably
960@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@puzzled, which made me feel more hopeful than I had been for days. It was a
961@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@great comfort to turn from that chap to my influential friend, the battered,
962@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@twisted, ruined, tin-pot steamboat. I clambered on board. She rang under my feet
963@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@like an empty Huntley &amp; Palmer biscuit-tin kicked along a gutter; she was
964@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@nothing so solid in make, and rather less pretty in shape, but I had expended
965@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@enough hard work on her to make me love her. No influential friend would have
966@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@served me better. She had given me a chance to come out a bit—to find out what I
967@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@could do. No, I don’t like work. I had rather laze about and think of all the
968@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@fine things that can be done. I don’t like work—no man does—but I like what is
969@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@in the work—the chance to find yourself. Your own reality—for yourself, not for
970@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@others—what no other man can ever know. They can only see the mere show, and
971@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@never can tell what it really means.
972@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@“I was not surprised to see somebody sitting aft, on the deck, with his legs
973@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@dangling over the mud. You see I rather chummed with the few mechanics there
974@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@were in that station, whom the other pilgrims naturally despised—on account of
975@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@their imperfect manners, I suppose. This was the foreman—a boiler-maker by
976@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@trade—a good worker. He was a lank, bony, yellow-faced man, with big intense
977@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@eyes. His aspect was worried, and his head was as bald as the palm of my hand;
978@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@but his hair in falling seemed to have stuck to his chin, and had prospered in
979@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@the new locality, for his beard hung down to his waist. He was a widower with
980@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@six young children (he had left them in charge of a sister of his to come out
981@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@there), and the passion of his life was pigeon-flying. He was an enthusiast and
982@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@a connoisseur. He would rave about pigeons. After work hours he used sometimes
983@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@to come over from his hut for a talk about his children and his pigeons; at
984@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@work, when he had to crawl in the mud under the bottom of the steamboat, he
985@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@would tie up that beard of his in a kind of white serviette he brought for the
986@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@purpose. It had loops to go over his ears. In the evening he could be seen
987@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@squatted on the bank rinsing that wrapper in the creek with great care, then
988@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@spreading it solemnly on a bush to dry.
989@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@“I slapped him on the back and shouted, ‘We shall have rivets!’ He scrambled to
990@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@his feet exclaiming, ‘No! Rivets!’ as though he couldn’t believe his ears. Then
991@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@in a low voice, ‘You... eh?’ I don’t know why we behaved like lunatics. I put my
992@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@finger to the side of my nose and nodded mysteriously. ‘Good for you!’ he cried,
993@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@snapped his fingers above his head, lifting one foot. I tried a jig. We capered
994@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@on the iron deck. A frightful clatter came out of that hulk, and the virgin
995@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@forest on the other bank of the creek sent it back in a thundering roll upon the
996@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@sleeping station. It must have made some of the pilgrims sit up in their hovels.
997@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@A dark figure obscured the lighted doorway of the manager’s hut, vanished, then,
998@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@a second or so after, the doorway itself vanished, too. We stopped, and the
999@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@silence driven away by the stamping of our feet flowed back again from the
1000@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@recesses of the land. The great wall of vegetation, an exuberant and entangled
1001@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@mass of trunks, branches, leaves, boughs, festoons, motionless in the moonlight,
1002@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@was like a rioting invasion of soundless life, a rolling wave of plants, piled
1003@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@up, crested, ready to topple over the creek, to sweep every little man of us out
1004@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@of his little existence. And it moved not. A deadened burst of mighty splashes
1005@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@and snorts reached us from afar, as though an icthyosaurus had been taking a
1006@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@bath of glitter in the great river. ‘After all,’ said the boiler-maker in a
1007@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@reasonable tone, ‘why shouldn’t we get the rivets?’ Why not, indeed! I did not
1008@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@know of any reason why we shouldn’t.  ‘They’ll come in three weeks,’ I said
1009@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@confidently.
1010@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@“But they didn’t. Instead of rivets there came an invasion, an infliction, a
1011@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@visitation. It came in sections during the next three weeks, each section headed
1012@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@by a donkey carrying a white man in new clothes and tan shoes, bowing from that
1013@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@elevation right and left to the impressed pilgrims.  A quarrelsome band of
1014@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@footsore sulky niggers trod on the heels of the donkey; a lot of tents,
1015@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@camp-stools, tin boxes, white cases, brown bales would be shot down in the
1016@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@courtyard, and the air of mystery would deepen a little over the muddle of the
1017@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@station. Five such instalments came, with their absurd air of disorderly flight
1018@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@with the loot of innumerable outfit shops and provision stores, that, one would
1019@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@think, they were lugging, after a raid, into the wilderness for equitable
1020@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@division. It was an inextricable mess of things decent in themselves but that
1021@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@human folly made look like the spoils of thieving.
1022@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@“This devoted band called itself the Eldorado Exploring Expedition, and I
1023@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@believe they were sworn to secrecy. Their talk, however, was the talk of sordid
1024@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@buccaneers: it was reckless without hardihood, greedy without audacity, and
1025@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@cruel without courage; there was not an atom of foresight or of serious
1026@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@intention in the whole batch of them, and they did not seem aware these things
1027@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@are wanted for the work of the world. To tear treasure out of the bowels of the
1028@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@land was their desire, with no more moral purpose at the back of it than there
1029@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@is in burglars breaking into a safe. Who paid the expenses of the noble
1030@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@enterprise I don’t know; but the uncle of our manager was leader of that lot.
1031@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@“In exterior he resembled a butcher in a poor neighbourhood, and his eyes had a
1032@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@look of sleepy cunning. He carried his fat paunch with ostentation on his short
1033@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@legs, and during the time his gang infested the station spoke to no one but his
1034@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@nephew. You could see these two roaming about all day long with their heads
1035@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@close together in an everlasting confab.
1036@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@“I had given up worrying myself about the rivets. One’s capacity for that kind
1037@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@of folly is more limited than you would suppose. I said Hang!—and let things
1038@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@slide. I had plenty of time for meditation, and now and then I would give some
1039@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@thought to Kurtz. I wasn’t very interested in him. No. Still, I was curious to
1040@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@see whether this man, who had come out equipped with moral ideas of some sort,
1041@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@1@0@0@0@would climb to the top after all and how he would set about his work when

1044@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@“One evening as I was lying flat on the deck of my steamboat, I heard voices
1045@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@approaching—and there were the nephew and the uncle strolling along the bank. I
1046@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@laid my head on my arm again, and had nearly lost myself in a doze, when
1047@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@somebody said in my ear, as it were: ‘I am as harmless as a little child, but I
1048@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@don’t like to be dictated to. Am I the manager—or am I not? I was ordered to
1049@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@send him there. It’s incredible.’ ... I became aware that the two were standing
1050@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@on the shore alongside the forepart of the steamboat, just below my head. I did
1051@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@not move; it did not occur to me to move: I was sleepy. ‘It _is_ unpleasant,’
1052@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@grunted the uncle. ‘He has asked the Administration to be sent there,’ said the
1053@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@other, ‘with the idea of showing what he could do; and I was instructed
1054@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@accordingly. Look at the influence that man must have. Is it not frightful?’
1055@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@They both agreed it was frightful, then made several bizarre remarks: ‘Make rain
1056@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@and fine weather—one man—the Council—by the nose’—bits of absurd sentences that
1057@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@got the better of my drowsiness, so that I had pretty near the whole of my wits
1058@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@about me when the uncle said, ‘The climate may do away with this difficulty for
1059@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@you. Is he alone there?’ ‘Yes,’ answered the manager; ‘he sent his assistant
1060@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@down the river with a note to me in these terms: ”Clear this poor devil out of
1061@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@the country, and don’t bother sending more of that sort. I had rather be alone
1062@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@than have the kind of men you can dispose of with me.“ It was more than a year
1063@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@ago. Can you imagine such impudence!’ ‘Anything since then?’ asked the other
1064@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@hoarsely. ‘Ivory,’ jerked the nephew; ‘lots of it—prime sort—lots—most annoying,
1065@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@from him.’ ‘And with that?’ questioned the heavy rumble. ‘Invoice,’ was the
1066@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@reply fired out, so to speak. Then silence. They had been talking about Kurtz.
1067@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@“I was broad awake by this time, but, lying perfectly at ease, remained still,
1068@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@having no inducement to change my position. ‘How did that ivory come all this
1069@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@way?’ growled the elder man, who seemed very vexed. The other explained that it
1070@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@had come with a fleet of canoes in charge of an English half-caste clerk Kurtz
1071@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@had with him; that Kurtz had apparently intended to return himself, the station
1072@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@being by that time bare of goods and stores, but after coming three hundred
1073@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@miles, had suddenly decided to go back, which he started to do alone in a small
1074@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@dugout with four paddlers, leaving the half-caste to continue down the river
1075@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@with the ivory. The two fellows there seemed astounded at anybody attempting
1076@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@such a thing. They were at a loss for an adequate motive. As to me, I seemed to
1077@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@see Kurtz for the first time. It was a distinct glimpse: the dugout, four
1078@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@paddling savages, and the lone white man turning his back suddenly on the
1079@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@headquarters, on relief, on thoughts of home—perhaps; setting his face towards
1080@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@the depths of the wilderness, towards his empty and desolate station. I did not
1081@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@know the motive. Perhaps he was just simply a fine fellow who stuck to his work
1082@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@for its own sake. His name, you understand, had not been pronounced once. He was
1083@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@‘that man.’ The half-caste, who, as far as I could see, had conducted a
1084@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@difficult trip with great prudence and pluck, was invariably alluded to as ‘that
1085@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@scoundrel.’ The ‘scoundrel’ had reported that the ‘man’ had been very ill—had
1086@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@recovered imperfectly.... The two below me moved away then a few paces, and
1087@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@strolled back and forth at some little distance. I heard: ’Military
1088@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@post—doctor—two hundred miles—quite alone now—unavoidable delays—nine months—no
1089@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@news—strange rumours.’ They approached again, just as the manager was saying,
1090@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@‘No one, as far as I know, unless a species of wandering trader—a pestilential
1091@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@fellow, snapping ivory from the natives.’ Who was it they were talking about
1092@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@now? I gathered in snatches that this was some man supposed to be in Kurtz’s
1093@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@district, and of whom the manager did not approve. ‘We will not be free from
1094@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@unfair competition till one of these fellows is hanged for an example,’ he said.
1095@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@‘Certainly,’ grunted the other; ‘get him hanged! Why not? Anything—anything can
1096@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@be done in this country. That’s what I say; nobody here, you understand, _here_,
1097@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@can endanger your position. And why? You stand the climate—you outlast them all.
1098@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@The danger is in Europe; but there before I left I took care to—’ They moved off
1099@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@and whispered, then their voices rose again. ‘The extraordinary series of delays
1100@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@is not my fault. I did my best.’ The fat man sighed. ‘Very sad.’ ‘And the
1101@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@pestiferous absurdity of his talk,’ continued the other; ‘he bothered me enough
1102@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@when he was here. ”Each station should be like a beacon on the road towards
1103@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@better things, a centre for trade of course, but also for humanizing, improving,
1104@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@instructing.“ Conceive you—that ass! And he wants to be manager! No, it’s—’ Here
1105@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@he got choked by excessive indignation, and I lifted my head the least bit. I
1106@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@was surprised to see how near they were—right under me. I could have spat upon
1107@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@their hats. They were looking on the ground, absorbed in thought. The manager
1108@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@was switching his leg with a slender twig: his sagacious relative lifted his
1109@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@head. ‘You have been well since you came out this time?’ he asked. The other
1110@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@gave a start. ‘Who? I? Oh! Like a charm—like a charm. But the rest—oh, my
1111@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@goodness! All sick. They die so quick, too, that I haven’t the time to send them
1112@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@out of the country—it’s incredible!’ ‘Hm’m. Just so,’ grunted the uncle. ‘Ah! my
1113@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@boy, trust to this—I say, trust to this.’ I saw him extend his short flipper of
1114@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@an arm for a gesture that took in the forest, the creek, the mud, the
1115@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@river—seemed to beckon with a dishonouring flourish before the sunlit face of
1116@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@the land a treacherous appeal to the lurking death, to the hidden evil, to the
1117@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@profound darkness of its heart. It was so startling that I leaped to my feet and
1118@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@looked back at the edge of the forest, as though I had expected an answer of
1119@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@some sort to that black display of confidence. You know the foolish notions that
1120@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@come to one sometimes. The high stillness confronted these two figures with its
1121@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@ominous patience, waiting for the passing away of a fantastic invasion.
1122@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@“They swore aloud together—out of sheer fright, I believe—then pretending not to
1123@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@know anything of my existence, turned back to the station. The sun was low; and
1124@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@leaning forward side by side, they seemed to be tugging painfully uphill their
1125@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@two ridiculous shadows of unequal length, that trailed behind them slowly over
1126@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@the tall grass without bending a single blade.
1127@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@“In a few days the Eldorado Expedition went into the patient wilderness, that
1128@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@closed upon it as the sea closes over a diver. Long afterwards the news came
1129@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@that all the donkeys were dead. I know nothing as to the fate of the less
1130@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@valuable animals. They, no doubt, like the rest of us, found what they deserved.
1131@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@I did not inquire. I was then rather excited at the prospect of meeting Kurtz
1132@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@very soon. When I say very soon I mean it comparatively.  It was just two months
1133@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@from the day we left the creek when we came to the bank below Kurtz’s station.
1134@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@“Going up that river was like traveling back to the earliest beginnings of the
1135@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@world, when vegetation rioted on the earth and the big trees were kings. An
1136@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@empty stream, a great silence, an impenetrable forest. The air was warm, thick,
1137@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@heavy, sluggish. There was no joy in the brilliance of sunshine. The long
1138@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@stretches of the waterway ran on, deserted, into the gloom of overshadowed
1139@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@distances. On silvery sand-banks hippos and alligators sunned themselves side by
1140@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@side. The broadening waters flowed through a mob of wooded islands; you lost
1141@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@your way on that river as you would in a desert, and butted all day long against
1142@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@shoals, trying to find the channel, till you thought yourself bewitched and cut
1143@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@off for ever from everything you had known once—somewhere—far away—in another
1144@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@existence perhaps. There were moments when one’s past came back to one, as it
1145@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@will sometimes when you have not a moment to spare for yourself; but it came in
1146@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@the shape of an unrestful and noisy dream, remembered with wonder amongst the
1147@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@overwhelming realities of this strange world of plants, and water, and silence.
1148@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@And this stillness of life did not in the least resemble a peace.  It was the
1149@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@stillness of an implacable force brooding over an inscrutable intention. It
1150@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@looked at you with a vengeful aspect. I got used to it afterwards; I did not see
1151@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@it any more; I had no time. I had to keep guessing at the channel; I had to
1152@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@discern, mostly by inspiration, the signs of hidden banks; I watched for sunken
1153@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@stones; I was learning to clap my teeth smartly before my heart flew out, when I
1154@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@shaved by a fluke some infernal sly old snag that would have ripped the life out
1155@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@of the tin-pot steamboat and drowned all the pilgrims; I had to keep a lookout
1156@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@for the signs of dead wood we could cut up in the night for next day’s steaming.
1157@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@When you have to attend to things of that sort, to the mere incidents of the
1158@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@surface, the reality—the reality, I tell you—fades. The inner truth is
1159@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@hidden—luckily, luckily. But I felt it all the same; I felt often its mysterious
1160@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@stillness watching me at my monkey tricks, just as it watches you fellows
1161@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@performing on your respective tight-ropes for—what is it?  half-a-crown a
1162@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@tumble—”
1163@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@“Try to be civil, Marlow,” growled a voice, and I knew there was at least one
1164@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@listener awake besides myself.
1165@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@“I beg your pardon. I forgot the heartache which makes up the rest of the price.
1166@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@And indeed what does the price matter, if the trick be well done?  You do your
1167@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@tricks very well. And I didn’t do badly either, since I managed not to sink that
1168@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@steamboat on my first trip. It’s a wonder to me yet.  Imagine a blindfolded man
1169@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@set to drive a van over a bad road. I sweated and shivered over that business
1170@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@considerably, I can tell you. After all, for a seaman, to scrape the bottom of
1171@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@the thing that’s supposed to float all the time under his care is the
1172@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@unpardonable sin. No one may know of it, but you never forget the thump—eh? A
1173@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@blow on the very heart. You remember it, you dream of it, you wake up at night
1174@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@and think of it—years after—and go hot and cold all over. I don’t pretend to say
1175@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@that steamboat floated all the time. More than once she had to wade for a bit,
1176@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@with twenty cannibals splashing around and pushing. We had enlisted some of
1177@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@these chaps on the way for a crew. Fine fellows—cannibals—in their place. They
1178@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@were men one could work with, and I am grateful to them. And, after all, they
1179@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@did not eat each other before my face: they had brought along a provision of
1180@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@hippo-meat which went rotten, and made the mystery of the wilderness stink in my
1181@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@nostrils. Phoo! I can sniff it now. I had the manager on board and three or four
1182@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@pilgrims with their staves—all complete.  Sometimes we came upon a station close
1183@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@by the bank, clinging to the skirts of the unknown, and the white men rushing
1184@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@out of a tumble-down hovel, with great gestures of joy and surprise and welcome,
1185@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@seemed very strange—had the appearance of being held there captive by a spell.
1186@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@The word ivory would ring in the air for a while—and on we went again into the
1187@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@silence, along empty reaches, round the still bends, between the high walls of
1188@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@our winding way, reverberating in hollow claps the ponderous beat of the
1189@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@stern-wheel.  Trees, trees, millions of trees, massive, immense, running up
1190@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@high; and at their foot, hugging the bank against the stream, crept the little
1191@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@begrimed steamboat, like a sluggish beetle crawling on the floor of a lofty
1192@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@portico.  It made you feel very small, very lost, and yet it was not altogether
1193@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@depressing, that feeling. After all, if you were small, the grimy beetle crawled
1194@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@on—which was just what you wanted it to do. Where the pilgrims imagined it
1195@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@crawled to I don’t know. To some place where they expected to get something. I
1196@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@bet! For me it crawled towards Kurtz—exclusively; but when the steam-pipes
1197@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@started leaking we crawled very slow. The reaches opened before us and closed
1198@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@behind, as if the forest had stepped leisurely across the water to bar the way
1199@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@for our return. We penetrated deeper and deeper into the heart of darkness. It
1200@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@was very quiet there. At night sometimes the roll of drums behind the curtain of
1201@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@trees would run up the river and remain sustained faintly, as if hovering in the
1202@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@air high over our heads, till the first break of day. Whether it meant war,
1203@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@peace, or prayer we could not tell. The dawns were heralded by the descent of a
1204@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@chill stillness; the wood-cutters slept, their fires burned low; the snapping of
1205@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@a twig would make you start. We were wanderers on a prehistoric earth, on an
1206@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@earth that wore the aspect of an unknown planet. We could have fancied ourselves
1207@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@the first of men taking possession of an accursed inheritance, to be subdued at
1208@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@the cost of profound anguish and of excessive toil. But suddenly, as we
1209@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@struggled round a bend, there would be a glimpse of rush walls, of peaked
1210@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@grass-roofs, a burst of yells, a whirl of black limbs, a mass of hands clapping
1211@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@of feet stamping, of bodies swaying, of eyes rolling, under the droop of heavy
1212@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@and motionless foliage. The steamer toiled along slowly on the edge of a black
1213@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@and incomprehensible frenzy. The prehistoric man was cursing us, praying to us,
1214@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@welcoming us—who could tell? We were cut off from the comprehension of our
1215@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@surroundings; we glided past like phantoms, wondering and secretly appalled, as
1216@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@sane men would be before an enthusiastic outbreak in a madhouse. We could not
1217@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@understand because we were too far and could not remember because we were
1218@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@travelling in the night of first ages, of those ages that are gone, leaving
1219@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@hardly a sign—and no memories.
1220@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@“The earth seemed unearthly. We are accustomed to look upon the shackled form of
1221@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@a conquered monster, but there—there you could look at a thing monstrous and
1222@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@free. It was unearthly, and the men were—No, they were not inhuman. Well, you
1223@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@know, that was the worst of it—this suspicion of their not being inhuman. It
1224@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@would come slowly to one. They howled and leaped, and spun, and made horrid
1225@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@faces; but what thrilled you was just the thought of their humanity—like
1226@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@yours—the thought of your remote kinship with this wild and passionate uproar.
1227@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@Ugly. Yes, it was ugly enough; but if you were man enough you would admit to
1228@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@yourself that there was in you just the faintest trace of a response to the
1229@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@terrible frankness of that noise, a dim suspicion of there being a meaning in it
1230@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@which you—you so remote from the night of first ages—could comprehend. And why
1231@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@not? The mind of man is capable of anything—because everything is in it, all the
1232@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@past as well as all the future. What was there after all? Joy, fear, sorrow,
1233@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@devotion, valour, rage—who can tell?—but truth—truth stripped of its cloak of
1234@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@time.  Let the fool gape and shudder—the man knows, and can look on without a
1235@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@wink. But he must at least be as much of a man as these on the shore. He must
1236@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@meet that truth with his own true stuff—with his own inborn strength.
1237@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@Principles won’t do. Acquisitions, clothes, pretty rags—rags that would fly off
1238@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@at the first good shake. No; you want a deliberate belief. An appeal to me in
1239@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@this fiendish row—is there? Very well; I hear; I admit, but I have a voice, too,
1240@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@and for good or evil mine is the speech that cannot be silenced. Of course, a
1241@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@fool, what with sheer fright and fine sentiments, is always safe. Who’s that
1242@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@grunting? You wonder I didn’t go ashore for a howl and a dance? Well, no—I
1243@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@didn’t. Fine sentiments, you say? Fine sentiments, be hanged! I had no time. I
1244@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@had to mess about with white-lead and strips of woolen blanket helping to put
1245@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@bandages on those leaky steam-pipes—I tell you. I had to watch the steering, and
1246@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@circumvent those snags, and get the tin-pot along by hook or by crook. There was
1247@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@surface-truth enough in these things to save a wiser man. And between whiles I
1248@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@had to look after the savage who was fireman. He was an improved specimen; he
1249@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@could fire up a vertical boiler. He was there below me, and, upon my word, to
1250@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@look at him was as edifying as seeing a dog in a parody of breeches and a
1251@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@feather hat, walking on his hind-legs. A few months of training had done for
1252@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@that really fine chap. He squinted at the steam-gauge and at the water-gauge
1253@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@with an evident effort of intrepidity—and he had filed teeth, too, the poor
1254@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@devil, and the wool of his pate shaved into queer patterns, and three ornamental
1255@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@scars on each of his cheeks. He ought to have been clapping his hands and
1256@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@stamping his feet on the bank, instead of which he was hard at work, a thrall to
1257@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@strange witchcraft, full of improving knowledge. He was useful because he had
1258@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@been instructed; and what he knew was this—that should the water in that
1259@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@transparent thing disappear, the evil spirit inside the boiler would get angry
1260@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@through the greatness of his thirst, and take a terrible vengeance. So he
1261@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@sweated and fired up and watched the glass fearfully (with an impromptu charm,
1262@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@made of rags, tied to his arm, and a piece of polished bone, as big as a watch,
1263@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@stuck flatways through his lower lip), while the wooded banks slipped past us
1264@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@slowly, the short noise was left behind, the interminable miles of silence—and
1265@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@we crept on, towards Kurtz. But the snags were thick, the water was treacherous
1266@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@and shallow, the boiler seemed indeed to have a sulky devil in it, and thus
1267@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@neither that fireman nor I had any time to peer into our creepy thoughts.
1268@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@“Some fifty miles below the Inner Station we came upon a hut of reeds, an
1269@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@inclined and melancholy pole, with the unrecognizable tatters of what had been a
1270@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@flag of some sort flying from it, and a neatly stacked wood-pile.  This was
1271@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@unexpected. We came to the bank, and on the stack of firewood found a flat piece
1272@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@of board with some faded pencil-writing on it. When deciphered it said: ‘Wood
1273@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@for you. Hurry up. Approach cautiously.’ There was a signature, but it was
1274@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@illegible—not Kurtz—a much longer word. ‘Hurry up.’ Where? Up the river?
1275@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@‘Approach cautiously.’ We had not done so. But the warning could not have been
1276@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@meant for the place where it could be only found after approach. Something was
1277@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@wrong above. But what—and how much?  That was the question. We commented
1278@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@adversely upon the imbecility of that telegraphic style. The bush around said
1279@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@nothing, and would not let us look very far, either. A torn curtain of red twill
1280@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@hung in the doorway of the hut, and flapped sadly in our faces. The dwelling was
1281@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@dismantled; but we could see a white man had lived there not very long ago.
1282@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@There remained a rude table—a plank on two posts; a heap of rubbish reposed in a
1283@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@dark corner, and by the door I picked up a book. It had lost its covers, and the
1284@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@pages had been thumbed into a state of extremely dirty softness; but the back
1285@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@had been lovingly stitched afresh with white cotton thread, which looked clean
1286@l>Line@oem>Line with Open Emphasis@2@0@0@0@yet. It was an extraordinary find. Its title was, _An Inquiry into some Points
1287@l>Line@cem>Line with Closed Emphasis@2@0@0@0@of Seamanship_, by a man Towser, Towson—some such name—Master in his Majesty’s
1288@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@Navy. The matter looked dreary reading enough, with illustrative diagrams and
1289@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@repulsive tables of figures, and the copy was sixty years old. I handled this
1290@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@amazing antiquity with the greatest possible tenderness, lest it should dissolve
1291@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@in my hands. Within, Towson or Towser was inquiring earnestly into the breaking
1292@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@strain of ships’ chains and tackle, and other such matters. Not a very
1293@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@enthralling book; but at the first glance you could see there a singleness of
1294@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@intention, an honest concern for the right way of going to work, which made
1295@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@these humble pages, thought out so many years ago, luminous with another than a
1296@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@professional light. The simple old sailor, with his talk of chains and
1297@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@purchases, made me forget the jungle and the pilgrims in a delicious sensation
1298@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@of having come upon something unmistakably real. Such a book being there was
1299@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@wonderful enough; but still more astounding were the notes pencilled in the
1300@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@margin, and plainly referring to the text. I couldn’t believe my eyes! They were
1301@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@in cipher! Yes, it looked like cipher. Fancy a man lugging with him a book of
1302@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@that description into this nowhere and studying it—and making notes—in cipher at
1303@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@that! It was an extravagant mystery.
1304@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@“I had been dimly aware for some time of a worrying noise, and when I lifted my
1305@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@eyes I saw the wood-pile was gone, and the manager, aided by all the pilgrims,
1306@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@was shouting at me from the riverside. I slipped the book into my pocket. I
1307@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@assure you to leave off reading was like tearing myself away from the shelter of
1308@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@an old and solid friendship.
1309@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@“I started the lame engine ahead. ‘It must be this miserable trader—this
1310@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@intruder,’ exclaimed the manager, looking back malevolently at the place we had
1311@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@left. ‘He must be English,’ I said. ‘It will not save him from getting into
1312@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@trouble if he is not careful,’ muttered the manager darkly.  I observed with
1313@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@assumed innocence that no man was safe from trouble in this world.
1314@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@“The current was more rapid now, the steamer seemed at her last gasp, the
1315@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@stern-wheel flopped languidly, and I caught myself listening on tiptoe for the
1316@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@next beat of the boat, for in sober truth I expected the wretched thing to give
1317@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@up every moment. It was like watching the last flickers of a life.  But still we
1318@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@crawled. Sometimes I would pick out a tree a little way ahead to measure our
1319@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@progress towards Kurtz by, but I lost it invariably before we got abreast. To
1320@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@keep the eyes so long on one thing was too much for human patience. The manager
1321@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@displayed a beautiful resignation. I fretted and fumed and took to arguing with
1322@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@myself whether or no I would talk openly with Kurtz; but before I could come to
1323@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@any conclusion it occurred to me that my speech or my silence, indeed any action
1324@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@of mine, would be a mere futility. What did it matter what any one knew or
1325@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@ignored? What did it matter who was manager? One gets sometimes such a flash of
1326@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@insight. The essentials of this affair lay deep under the surface, beyond my
1327@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@reach, and beyond my power of meddling.
1328@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@“Towards the evening of the second day we judged ourselves about eight miles
1329@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@from Kurtz’s station. I wanted to push on; but the manager looked grave, and
1330@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@told me the navigation up there was so dangerous that it would be advisable, the
1331@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@sun being very low already, to wait where we were till next morning. Moreover,
1332@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@he pointed out that if the warning to approach cautiously were to be followed,
1333@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@we must approach in daylight—not at dusk or in the dark. This was sensible
1334@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@enough. Eight miles meant nearly three hours’ steaming for us, and I could also
1335@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@see suspicious ripples at the upper end of the reach. Nevertheless, I was
1336@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@annoyed beyond expression at the delay, and most unreasonably, too, since one
1337@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@night more could not matter much after so many months. As we had plenty of wood,
1338@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@and caution was the word, I brought up in the middle of the stream. The reach
1339@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@was narrow, straight, with high sides like a railway cutting. The dusk came
1340@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@gliding into it long before the sun had set. The current ran smooth and swift,
1341@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@but a dumb immobility sat on the banks. The living trees, lashed together by the
1342@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@creepers and every living bush of the undergrowth, might have been changed into
1343@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@stone, even to the slenderest twig, to the lightest leaf. It was not sleep—it
1344@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@seemed unnatural, like a state of trance. Not the faintest sound of any kind
1345@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@could be heard. You looked on amazed, and began to suspect yourself of being
1346@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@deaf—then the night came suddenly, and struck you blind as well. About three in
1347@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@the morning some large fish leaped, and the loud splash made me jump as though a
1348@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@gun had been fired. When the sun rose there was a white fog, very warm and
1349@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@clammy, and more blinding than the night. It did not shift or drive; it was just
1350@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@there, standing all round you like something solid. At eight or nine, perhaps,
1351@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@it lifted as a shutter lifts. We had a glimpse of the towering multitude of
1352@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@trees, of the immense matted jungle, with the blazing little ball of the sun
1353@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@hanging over it—all perfectly still—and then the white shutter came down again,
1354@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@smoothly, as if sliding in greased grooves. I ordered the chain, which we had
1355@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@begun to heave in, to be paid out again. Before it stopped running with a
1356@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@muffled rattle, a cry, a very loud cry, as of infinite desolation, soared slowly
1357@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@in the opaque air. It ceased. A complaining clamour, modulated in savage
1358@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@discords, filled our ears. The sheer unexpectedness of it made my hair stir
1359@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@under my cap. I don’t know how it struck the others: to me it seemed as though
1360@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@the mist itself had screamed, so suddenly, and apparently from all sides at
1361@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@once, did this tumultuous and mournful uproar arise. It culminated in a hurried
1362@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@outbreak of almost intolerably excessive shrieking, which stopped short, leaving
1363@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@us stiffened in a variety of silly attitudes, and obstinately listening to the
1364@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@nearly as appalling and excessive silence.  ‘Good God! What is the meaning—’
1365@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@stammered at my elbow one of the pilgrims—a little fat man, with sandy hair and
1366@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@red whiskers, who wore sidespring boots, and pink pyjamas tucked into his socks.
1367@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@Two others remained open-mouthed a while minute, then dashed into the little
1368@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@cabin, to rush out incontinently and stand darting scared glances, with
1369@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@Winchesters at ’ready’ in their hands. What we could see was just the steamer we
1370@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@were on, her outlines blurred as though she had been on the point of dissolving,
1371@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@and a misty strip of water, perhaps two feet broad, around her—and that was all.
1372@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@The rest of the world was nowhere, as far as our eyes and ears were concerned.
1373@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@Just nowhere. Gone, disappeared; swept off without leaving a whisper or a shadow
1374@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@behind.
1375@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@“I went forward, and ordered the chain to be hauled in short, so as to be ready
1376@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@to trip the anchor and move the steamboat at once if necessary.  ’Will they
1377@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@attack?’ whispered an awed voice. ‘We will be all butchered in this fog,’
1378@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@murmured another. The faces twitched with the strain, the hands trembled
1379@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@slightly, the eyes forgot to wink. It was very curious to see the contrast of
1380@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@expressions of the white men and of the black fellows of our crew, who were as
1381@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@much strangers to that part of the river as we, though their homes were only
1382@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@eight hundred miles away. The whites, of course greatly discomposed, had besides
1383@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@a curious look of being painfully shocked by such an outrageous row. The others
1384@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@had an alert, naturally interested expression; but their faces were essentially
1385@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@quiet, even those of the one or two who grinned as they hauled at the chain.
1386@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@Several exchanged short, grunting phrases, which seemed to settle the matter to
1387@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@their satisfaction.  Their headman, a young, broad-chested black, severely
1388@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@draped in dark-blue fringed cloths, with fierce nostrils and his hair all done
1389@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@up artfully in oily ringlets, stood near me. ’Aha!’ I said, just for good
1390@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@fellowship’s sake. ‘Catch ‘im,’ he snapped, with a bloodshot widening of his
1391@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@eyes and a flash of sharp teeth—‘catch ’im. Give ‘im to us.’ ‘To you, eh?’ I
1392@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@asked; ‘what would you do with them?’ ‘Eat ‘im!’ he said curtly, and, leaning
1393@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@his elbow on the rail, looked out into the fog in a dignified and profoundly
1394@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@pensive attitude. I would no doubt have been properly horrified, had it not
1395@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@occurred to me that he and his chaps must be very hungry: that they must have
1396@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@been growing increasingly hungry for at least this month past.  They had been
1397@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@engaged for six months (I don’t think a single one of them had any clear idea of
1398@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@time, as we at the end of countless ages have. They still belonged to the
1399@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@beginnings of time—had no inherited experience to teach them as it were), and of
1400@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@course, as long as there was a piece of paper written over in accordance with
1401@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@some farcical law or other made down the river, it didn’t enter anybody’s head
1402@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@to trouble how they would live.  Certainly they had brought with them some
1403@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@rotten hippo-meat, which couldn’t have lasted very long, anyway, even if the
1404@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@pilgrims hadn’t, in the midst of a shocking hullabaloo, thrown a considerable
1405@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@quantity of it overboard. It looked like a high-handed proceeding; but it was
1406@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@really a case of legitimate self-defence. You can’t breathe dead hippo waking,
1407@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@sleeping, and eating, and at the same time keep your precarious grip on
1408@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@existence.  Besides that, they had given them every week three pieces of brass
1409@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@wire, each about nine inches long; and the theory was they were to buy their
1410@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@provisions with that currency in riverside villages. You can see how _that_
1411@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@worked. There were either no villages, or the people were hostile, or the
1412@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@director, who like the rest of us fed out of tins, with an occasional old
1413@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@he-goat thrown in, didn’t want to stop the steamer for some more or less
1414@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@recondite reason. So, unless they swallowed the wire itself, or made loops of it
1415@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@to snare the fishes with, I don’t see what good their extravagant salary could
1416@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@be to them. I must say it was paid with a regularity worthy of a large and
1417@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@honourable trading company. For the rest, the only thing to eat—though it didn’t
1418@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@look eatable in the least—I saw in their possession was a few lumps of some
1419@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@stuff like half-cooked dough, of a dirty lavender colour, they kept wrapped in
1420@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@leaves, and now and then swallowed a piece of, but so small that it seemed done
1421@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@more for the looks of the thing than for any serious purpose of sustenance. Why
1422@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@in the name of all the gnawing devils of hunger they didn’t go for us—they were
1423@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@thirty to five—and have a good tuck-in for once, amazes me now when I think of
1424@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@it. They were big powerful men, with not much capacity to weigh the
1425@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@consequences, with courage, with strength, even yet, though their skins were no
1426@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@longer glossy and their muscles no longer hard. And I saw that something
1427@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@restraining, one of those human secrets that baffle probability, had come into
1428@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@play there.  I looked at them with a swift quickening of interest—not because it
1429@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@occurred to me I might be eaten by them before very long, though I own to you
1430@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@that just then I perceived—in a new light, as it were—how unwholesome the
1431@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@pilgrims looked, and I hoped, yes, I positively hoped, that my aspect was not
1432@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@so—what shall I say?—so—unappetizing: a touch of fantastic vanity which fitted
1433@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@well with the dream-sensation that pervaded all my days at that time. Perhaps I
1434@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@had a little fever, too. One can’t live with one’s finger everlastingly on one’s
1435@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@pulse. I had often ‘a little fever,’ or a little touch of other things—the
1436@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@playful paw-strokes of the wilderness, the preliminary trifling before the more
1437@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@serious onslaught which came in due course. Yes; I looked at them as you would
1438@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@on any human being, with a curiosity of their impulses, motives, capacities,
1439@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@weaknesses, when brought to the test of an inexorable physical necessity.
1440@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@Restraint! What possible restraint? Was it superstition, disgust, patience,
1441@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@fear—or some kind of primitive honour? No fear can stand up to hunger, no
1442@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@patience can wear it out, disgust simply does not exist where hunger is; and as
1443@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@to superstition, beliefs, and what you may call principles, they are less than
1444@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@chaff in a breeze. Don’t you know the devilry of lingering starvation, its
1445@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@exasperating torment, its black thoughts, its sombre and brooding ferocity?
1446@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@Well, I do. It takes a man all his inborn strength to fight hunger properly.
1447@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@It’s really easier to face bereavement, dishonour, and the perdition of one’s
1448@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@soul—than this kind of prolonged hunger. Sad, but true.  And these chaps, too,
1449@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@had no earthly reason for any kind of scruple.  Restraint! I would just as soon
1450@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@have expected restraint from a hyena prowling amongst the corpses of a
1451@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@battlefield. But there was the fact facing me—the fact dazzling, to be seen,
1452@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@like the foam on the depths of the sea, like a ripple on an unfathomable enigma,
1453@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@a mystery greater—when I thought of it—than the curious, inexplicable note of
1454@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@desperate grief in this savage clamour that had swept by us on the river-bank,
1455@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@behind the blind whiteness of the fog.
1456@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@“Two pilgrims were quarrelling in hurried whispers as to which bank.  ’Left.’
1457@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@‘no, no; how can you? Right, right, of course.’ ‘It is very serious,’ said the
1458@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@manager’s voice behind me; ‘I would be desolated if anything should happen to
1459@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@Mr. Kurtz before we came up.’ I looked at him, and had not the slightest doubt
1460@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@he was sincere. He was just the kind of man who would wish to preserve
1461@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@appearances. That was his restraint. But when he muttered something about going
1462@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@on at once, I did not even take the trouble to answer him. I knew, and he knew,
1463@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@that it was impossible. Were we to let go our hold of the bottom, we would be
1464@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@absolutely in the air—in space. We wouldn’t be able to tell where we were going
1465@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@to—whether up or down stream, or across—till we fetched against one bank or the
1466@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@other—and then we wouldn’t know at first which it was. Of course I made no move.
1467@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@I had no mind for a smash-up. You couldn’t imagine a more deadly place for a
1468@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@shipwreck. Whether we drowned at once or not, we were sure to perish speedily in
1469@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@one way or another. ‘I authorize you to take all the risks,’ he said, after a
1470@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@short silence. ’I refuse to take any,’ I said shortly; which was just the answer
1471@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@he expected, though its tone might have surprised him.  ‘Well, I must defer to
1472@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@your judgment. You are captain,’ he said with marked civility. I turned my
1473@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@shoulder to him in sign of my appreciation, and looked into the fog. How long
1474@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@would it last? It was the most hopeless lookout. The approach to this Kurtz
1475@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@grubbing for ivory in the wretched bush was beset by as many dangers as though
1476@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@he had been an enchanted princess sleeping in a fabulous castle. ‘Will they
1477@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@attack, do you think?’ asked the manager, in a confidential tone.
1478@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@“I did not think they would attack, for several obvious reasons. The thick fog
1479@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@was one. If they left the bank in their canoes they would get lost in it, as we
1480@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@would be if we attempted to move. Still, I had also judged the jungle of both
1481@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@banks quite impenetrable—and yet eyes were in it, eyes that had seen us. The
1482@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@riverside bushes were certainly very thick; but the undergrowth behind was
1483@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@evidently penetrable. However, during the short lift I had seen no canoes
1484@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@anywhere in the reach—certainly not abreast of the steamer. But what made the
1485@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@idea of attack inconceivable to me was the nature of the noise—of the cries we
1486@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@had heard. They had not the fierce character boding immediate hostile intention.
1487@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@Unexpected, wild, and violent as they had been, they had given me an
1488@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@irresistible impression of sorrow.  The glimpse of the steamboat had for some
1489@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@reason filled those savages with unrestrained grief. The danger, if any, I
1490@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@expounded, was from our proximity to a great human passion let loose. Even
1491@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@extreme grief may ultimately vent itself in violence—but more generally takes
1492@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@the form of apathy....
1493@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@“You should have seen the pilgrims stare! They had no heart to grin, or even to
1494@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@revile me: but I believe they thought me gone mad—with fright, maybe. I
1495@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@delivered a regular lecture. My dear boys, it was no good bothering. Keep a
1496@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@lookout? Well, you may guess I watched the fog for the signs of lifting as a cat
1497@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@watches a mouse; but for anything else our eyes were of no more use to us than
1498@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@if we had been buried miles deep in a heap of cotton-wool. It felt like it,
1499@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@too—choking, warm, stifling. Besides, all I said, though it sounded extravagant,
1500@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@was absolutely true to fact. What we afterwards alluded to as an attack was
1501@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@really an attempt at repulse. The action was very far from being aggressive—it
1502@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@was not even defensive, in the usual sense: it was undertaken under the stress
1503@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@of desperation, and in its essence was purely protective.
1504@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@“It developed itself, I should say, two hours after the fog lifted, and its
1505@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@commencement was at a spot, roughly speaking, about a mile and a half below
1506@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@Kurtz’s station. We had just floundered and flopped round a bend, when I saw an
1507@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@islet, a mere grassy hummock of bright green, in the middle of the stream. It
1508@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@was the only thing of the kind; but as we opened the reach more, I perceived it
1509@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@was the head of a long sand-bank, or rather of a chain of shallow patches
1510@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@stretching down the middle of the river. They were discoloured, just awash, and
1511@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@the whole lot was seen just under the water, exactly as a man’s backbone is seen
1512@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@running down the middle of his back under the skin. Now, as far as I did see, I
1513@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@could go to the right or to the left of this. I didn’t know either channel, of
1514@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@course. The banks looked pretty well alike, the depth appeared the same; but as
1515@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@I had been informed the station was on the west side, I naturally headed for the
1516@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@western passage.
1517@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@“No sooner had we fairly entered it than I became aware it was much narrower
1518@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@than I had supposed. To the left of us there was the long uninterrupted shoal,
1519@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@and to the right a high, steep bank heavily overgrown with bushes. Above the
1520@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@bush the trees stood in serried ranks. The twigs overhung the current thickly,
1521@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@and from distance to distance a large limb of some tree projected rigidly over
1522@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@the stream. It was then well on in the afternoon, the face of the forest was
1523@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@gloomy, and a broad strip of shadow had already fallen on the water. In this
1524@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@shadow we steamed up—very slowly, as you may imagine. I sheered her well
1525@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@inshore—the water being deepest near the bank, as the sounding-pole informed me.
1526@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@“One of my hungry and forbearing friends was sounding in the bows just below me.
1527@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@This steamboat was exactly like a decked scow. On the deck, there were two
1528@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@little teakwood houses, with doors and windows. The boiler was in the fore-end,
1529@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@and the machinery right astern. Over the whole there was a light roof, supported
1530@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@on stanchions. The funnel projected through that roof, and in front of the
1531@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@funnel a small cabin built of light planks served for a pilot-house. It
1532@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@contained a couch, two camp-stools, a loaded Martini-Henry leaning in one
1533@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@corner, a tiny table, and the steering-wheel.  It had a wide door in front and a
1534@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@broad shutter at each side. All these were always thrown open, of course. I
1535@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@spent my days perched up there on the extreme fore-end of that roof, before the
1536@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@door. At night I slept, or tried to, on the couch. An athletic black belonging
1537@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@to some coast tribe and educated by my poor predecessor, was the helmsman. He
1538@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@sported a pair of brass earrings, wore a blue cloth wrapper from the waist to
1539@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@the ankles, and thought all the world of himself. He was the most unstable kind
1540@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@of fool I had ever seen. He steered with no end of a swagger while you were by;
1541@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@but if he lost sight of you, he became instantly the prey of an abject funk, and
1542@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@would let that cripple of a steamboat get the upper hand of him in a minute.
1543@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@“I was looking down at the sounding-pole, and feeling much annoyed to see at
1544@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@each try a little more of it stick out of that river, when I saw my poleman give
1545@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@up on the business suddenly, and stretch himself flat on the deck, without even
1546@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@taking the trouble to haul his pole in. He kept hold on it though, and it
1547@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@trailed in the water. At the same time the fireman, whom I could also see below
1548@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@me, sat down abruptly before his furnace and ducked his head. I was amazed. Then
1549@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@I had to look at the river mighty quick, because there was a snag in the
1550@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@fairway. Sticks, little sticks, were flying about—thick: they were whizzing
1551@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@before my nose, dropping below me, striking behind me against my pilot-house.
1552@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@All this time the river, the shore, the woods, were very quiet—perfectly quiet.
1553@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@I could only hear the heavy splashing thump of the stern-wheel and the patter of
1554@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@these things. We cleared the snag clumsily. Arrows, by Jove! We were being shot
1555@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@at!  I stepped in quickly to close the shutter on the landside. That
1556@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@fool-helmsman, his hands on the spokes, was lifting his knees high, stamping his
1557@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@feet, champing his mouth, like a reined-in horse. Confound him! And we were
1558@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@staggering within ten feet of the bank. I had to lean right out to swing the
1559@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@heavy shutter, and I saw a face amongst the leaves on the level with my own,
1560@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@looking at me very fierce and steady; and then suddenly, as though a veil had
1561@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@been removed from my eyes, I made out, deep in the tangled gloom, naked breasts,
1562@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@arms, legs, glaring eyes—the bush was swarming with human limbs in movement,
1563@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@glistening of bronze colour. The twigs shook, swayed, and rustled, the arrows
1564@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@flew out of them, and then the shutter came to. ’Steer her straight,’ I said to
1565@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@the helmsman. He held his head rigid, face forward; but his eyes rolled, he kept
1566@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@on lifting and setting down his feet gently, his mouth foamed a little. ‘Keep
1567@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@quiet!’ I said in a fury. I might just as well have ordered a tree not to sway
1568@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@in the wind. I darted out. Below me there was a great scuffle of feet on the
1569@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@iron deck; confused exclamations; a voice screamed, ‘Can you turn back?’ I
1570@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@caught sight of a V-shaped ripple on the water ahead. What? Another snag!  A
1571@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@fusillade burst out under my feet. The pilgrims had opened with their
1572@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@Winchesters, and were simply squirting lead into that bush. A deuce of a lot of
1573@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@smoke came up and drove slowly forward. I swore at it. Now I couldn’t see the
1574@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@ripple or the snag either. I stood in the doorway, peering, and the arrows came
1575@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@in swarms. They might have been poisoned, but they looked as though they
1576@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@wouldn’t kill a cat. The bush began to howl. Our wood-cutters raised a warlike
1577@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@whoop; the report of a rifle just at my back deafened me. I glanced over my
1578@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@shoulder, and the pilot-house was yet full of noise and smoke when I made a dash
1579@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@at the wheel. The fool-nigger had dropped everything, to throw the shutter open
1580@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@and let off that Martini-Henry. He stood before the wide opening, glaring, and I
1581@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@yelled at him to come back, while I straightened the sudden twist out of that
1582@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@steamboat. There was no room to turn even if I had wanted to, the snag was
1583@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@somewhere very near ahead in that confounded smoke, there was no time to lose,
1584@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@so I just crowded her into the bank—right into the bank, where I knew the water
1585@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@was deep.
1586@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@“We tore slowly along the overhanging bushes in a whirl of broken twigs and
1587@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@flying leaves. The fusillade below stopped short, as I had foreseen it would
1588@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@when the squirts got empty. I threw my head back to a glinting whizz that
1589@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@traversed the pilot-house, in at one shutter-hole and out at the other. Looking
1590@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@past that mad helmsman, who was shaking the empty rifle and yelling at the
1591@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@shore, I saw vague forms of men running bent double, leaping, gliding, distinct,
1592@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@incomplete, evanescent. Something big appeared in the air before the shutter,
1593@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@the rifle went overboard, and the man stepped back swiftly, looked at me over
1594@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@his shoulder in an extraordinary, profound, familiar manner, and fell upon my
1595@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@feet. The side of his head hit the wheel twice, and the end of what appeared a
1596@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@long cane clattered round and knocked over a little camp-stool. It looked as
1597@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@though after wrenching that thing from somebody ashore he had lost his balance
1598@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@in the effort. The thin smoke had blown away, we were clear of the snag, and
1599@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@looking ahead I could see that in another hundred yards or so I would be free to
1600@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@sheer off, away from the bank; but my feet felt so very warm and wet that I had
1601@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@to look down. The man had rolled on his back and stared straight up at me; both
1602@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@his hands clutched that cane. It was the shaft of a spear that, either thrown or
1603@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@lunged through the opening, had caught him in the side, just below the ribs; the
1604@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@blade had gone in out of sight, after making a frightful gash; my shoes were
1605@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@full; a pool of blood lay very still, gleaming dark-red under the wheel; his
1606@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@eyes shone with an amazing lustre.  The fusillade burst out again. He looked at
1607@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@me anxiously, gripping the spear like something precious, with an air of being
1608@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@afraid I would try to take it away from him. I had to make an effort to free my
1609@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@eyes from his gaze and attend to the steering. With one hand I felt above my
1610@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@head for the line of the steam whistle, and jerked out screech after screech
1611@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@hurriedly.  The tumult of angry and warlike yells was checked instantly, and
1612@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@then from the depths of the woods went out such a tremulous and prolonged wail
1613@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@of mournful fear and utter despair as may be imagined to follow the flight of
1614@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@the last hope from the earth. There was a great commotion in the bush; the
1615@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@shower of arrows stopped, a few dropping shots rang out sharply—then silence, in
1616@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@which the languid beat of the stern-wheel came plainly to my ears. I put the
1617@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@helm hard a-starboard at the moment when the pilgrim in pink pyjamas, very hot
1618@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@and agitated, appeared in the doorway. ‘The manager sends me—’ he began in an
1619@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@official tone, and stopped short. ‘Good God!’ he said, glaring at the wounded
1620@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@man.
1621@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@“We two whites stood over him, and his lustrous and inquiring glance enveloped
1622@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@us both. I declare it looked as though he would presently put to us some
1623@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@questions in an understandable language; but he died without uttering a sound,
1624@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@without moving a limb, without twitching a muscle. Only in the very last moment,
1625@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@as though in response to some sign we could not see, to some whisper we could
1626@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@not hear, he frowned heavily, and that frown gave to his black death-mask an
1627@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@inconceivably sombre, brooding, and menacing expression. The lustre of inquiring
1628@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@glance faded swiftly into vacant glassiness. ‘Can you steer?’ I asked the agent
1629@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@eagerly. He looked very dubious; but I made a grab at his arm, and he understood
1630@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@at once I meant him to steer whether or no. To tell you the truth, I was
1631@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@morbidly anxious to change my shoes and socks. ‘He is dead,’ murmured the
1632@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@fellow, immensely impressed. ‘No doubt about it,’ said I, tugging like mad at
1633@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@the shoe-laces. ‘And by the way, I suppose Mr. Kurtz is dead as well by this
1634@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@time.’
1635@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@“For the moment that was the dominant thought. There was a sense of extreme
1636@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@disappointment, as though I had found out I had been striving after something
1637@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@altogether without a substance. I couldn’t have been more disgusted if I had
1638@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@travelled all this way for the sole purpose of talking with Mr. Kurtz. Talking
1639@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@with... I flung one shoe overboard, and became aware that that was exactly what
1640@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@I had been looking forward to—a talk with Kurtz. I made the strange discovery
1641@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@that I had never imagined him as doing, you know, but as discoursing. I didn’t
1642@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@say to myself, ‘Now I will never see him,’ or ‘Now I will never shake him by the
1643@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@hand,’ but, ‘Now I will never hear him.’ The man presented himself as a voice.
1644@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@Not of course that I did not connect him with some sort of action. Hadn’t I been
1645@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@told in all the tones of jealousy and admiration that he had collected,
1646@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@bartered, swindled, or stolen more ivory than all the other agents together?
1647@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@That was not the point. The point was in his being a gifted creature, and that
1648@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@of all his gifts the one that stood out preeminently, that carried with it a
1649@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@sense of real presence, was his ability to talk, his words—the gift of
1650@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@expression, the bewildering, the illuminating, the most exalted and the most
1651@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@contemptible, the pulsating stream of light, or the deceitful flow from the
1652@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@heart of an impenetrable darkness.
1653@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@“The other shoe went flying unto the devil-god of that river. I thought, ’By
1654@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@Jove! it’s all over. We are too late; he has vanished—the gift has vanished, by
1655@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@means of some spear, arrow, or club. I will never hear that chap speak after
1656@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@all’—and my sorrow had a startling extravagance of emotion, even such as I had
1657@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@noticed in the howling sorrow of these savages in the bush. I couldn’t have felt
1658@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@more of lonely desolation somehow, had I been robbed of a belief or had missed
1659@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@my destiny in life.... Why do you sigh in this beastly way, somebody? Absurd?
1660@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@Well, absurd. Good Lord!  mustn’t a man ever—Here, give me some tobacco.”...
1661@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@There was a pause of profound stillness, then a match flared, and Marlow’s lean
1662@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@face appeared, worn, hollow, with downward folds and dropped eyelids, with an
1663@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@aspect of concentrated attention; and as he took vigorous draws at his pipe, it
1664@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@seemed to retreat and advance out of the night in the regular flicker of tiny
1665@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@flame. The match went out.
1666@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@“Absurd!” he cried. “This is the worst of trying to tell.... Here you all are,

1668@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@round one corner, a policeman round another, excellent appetites, and
1669@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@temperature normal—you hear—normal from year’s end to year’s end. And you say,
1670@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@Absurd! Absurd be—exploded! Absurd! My dear boys, what can you expect from a man
1671@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@who out of sheer nervousness had just flung overboard a pair of new shoes! Now I
1672@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@think of it, it is amazing I did not shed tears.  I am, upon the whole, proud of
1673@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@my fortitude. I was cut to the quick at the idea of having lost the inestimable
1674@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@privilege of listening to the gifted Kurtz. Of course I was wrong. The privilege
1675@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@was waiting for me. Oh, yes, I heard more than enough. And I was right, too. A
1676@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@voice. He was very little more than a voice. And I heard—him—it—this voice—other
1677@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@voices—all of them were so little more than voices—and the memory of that time
1678@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@itself lingers around me, impalpable, like a dying vibration of one immense
1679@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@jabber, silly, atrocious, sordid, savage, or simply mean, without any kind of
1680@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@sense.  Voices, voices—even the girl herself—now—”
1681@sl>Single Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@He was silent for a long time.
1682@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@“I laid the ghost of his gifts at last with a lie,” he began, suddenly.  “Girl!
1683@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@What? Did I mention a girl? Oh, she is out of it—completely.  They—the women, I
1684@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@mean—are out of it—should be out of it. We must help them to stay in that
1685@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@beautiful world of their own, lest ours gets worse. Oh, she had to be out of it.
1686@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@You should have heard the disinterred body of Mr.  Kurtz saying, ‘My Intended.’
1687@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@You would have perceived directly then how completely she was out of it. And the
1688@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@lofty frontal bone of Mr. Kurtz! They say the hair goes on growing sometimes,
1689@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@but this—ah—specimen, was impressively bald. The wilderness had patted him on
1690@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@the head, and, behold, it was like a ball—an ivory ball; it had caressed him,
1691@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@and—lo!—he had withered; it had taken him, loved him, embraced him, got into his
1692@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@veins, consumed his flesh, and sealed his soul to its own by the inconceivable
1693@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@ceremonies of some devilish initiation. He was its spoiled and pampered
1694@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@favourite. Ivory? I should think so. Heaps of it, stacks of it. The old mud
1695@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@shanty was bursting with it. You would think there was not a single tusk left
1696@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@either above or below the ground in the whole country. ‘Mostly fossil,’ the
1697@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@manager had remarked, disparagingly. It was no more fossil than I am; but they
1698@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@call it fossil when it is dug up. It appears these niggers do bury the tusks
1699@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@sometimes—but evidently they couldn’t bury this parcel deep enough to save the
1700@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@gifted Mr. Kurtz from his fate. We filled the steamboat with it, and had to pile
1701@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@a lot on the deck. Thus he could see and enjoy as long as he could see, because
1702@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@the appreciation of this favour had remained with him to the last. You should
1703@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@have heard him say, ’My ivory.’ Oh, yes, I heard him. ‘My Intended, my ivory, my
1704@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@station, my river, my—’ everything belonged to him. It made me hold my breath in
1705@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@expectation of hearing the wilderness burst into a prodigious peal of laughter
1706@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@that would shake the fixed stars in their places. Everything belonged to him—but
1707@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@that was a trifle. The thing was to know what he belonged to, how many powers of
1708@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@darkness claimed him for their own. That was the reflection that made you creepy
1709@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@all over. It was impossible—it was not good for one either—trying to imagine. He
1710@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@had taken a high seat amongst the devils of the land—I mean literally. You can’t
1711@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@understand. How could you?—with solid pavement under your feet, surrounded by
1712@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@kind neighbours ready to cheer you or to fall on you, stepping delicately
1713@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@between the butcher and the policeman, in the holy terror of scandal and gallows
1714@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@and lunatic asylums—how can you imagine what particular region of the first ages
1715@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@a man’s untrammelled feet may take him into by the way of solitude—utter
1716@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@solitude without a policeman—by the way of silence—utter silence, where no
1717@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@warning voice of a kind neighbour can be heard whispering of public opinion?
1718@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@These little things make all the great difference. When they are gone you must
1719@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@fall back upon your own innate strength, upon your own capacity for
1720@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@faithfulness. Of course you may be too much of a fool to go wrong—too dull even
1721@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@to know you are being assaulted by the powers of darkness. I take it, no fool
1722@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@ever made a bargain for his soul with the devil; the fool is too much of a fool,
1723@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@or the devil too much of a devil—I don’t know which. Or you may be such a
1724@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@thunderingly exalted creature as to be altogether deaf and blind to anything but
1725@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@heavenly sights and sounds.  Then the earth for you is only a standing place—and
1726@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@whether to be like this is your loss or your gain I won’t pretend to say. But
1727@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@most of us are neither one nor the other. The earth for us is a place to live
1728@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@in, where we must put up with sights, with sounds, with smells, too, by
1729@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@Jove!—breathe dead hippo, so to speak, and not be contaminated. And there, don’t
1730@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@you see?  Your strength comes in, the faith in your ability for the digging of
1731@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@unostentatious holes to bury the stuff in—your power of devotion, not to
1732@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@yourself, but to an obscure, back-breaking business. And that’s difficult
1733@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@enough. Mind, I am not trying to excuse or even explain—I am trying to account
1734@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@to myself for—for—Mr. Kurtz—for the shade of Mr. Kurtz. This initiated wraith
1735@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@from the back of Nowhere honoured me with its amazing confidence before it
1736@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@vanished altogether. This was because it could speak English to me. The original
1737@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@Kurtz had been educated partly in England, and—as he was good enough to say
1738@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@himself—his sympathies were in the right place. His mother was half-English, his
1739@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@father was half-French. All Europe contributed to the making of Kurtz; and by
1740@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@and by I learned that, most appropriately, the International Society for the
1741@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@Suppression of Savage Customs had intrusted him with the making of a report, for
1742@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@its future guidance. And he had written it, too. I’ve seen it. I’ve read it. It
1743@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@was eloquent, vibrating with eloquence, but too high-strung, I think. Seventeen
1744@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@pages of close writing he had found time for! But this must have been before
1745@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@his—let us say—nerves, went wrong, and caused him to preside at certain midnight
1746@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@dances ending with unspeakable rites, which—as far as I reluctantly gathered
1747@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@from what I heard at various times—were offered up to him—do you understand?—to
1748@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@Mr. Kurtz himself. But it was a beautiful piece of writing. The opening
1749@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@paragraph, however, in the light of later information, strikes me now as
1750@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@ominous. He began with the argument that we whites, from the point of
1751@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@development we had arrived at, ‘must necessarily appear to them [savages] in the
1752@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@nature of supernatural beings—we approach them with the might of a deity,’ and
1753@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@so on, and so on. ‘By the simple exercise of our will we can exert a power for
1754@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@good practically unbounded,’ etc., etc. From that point he soared and took me
1755@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@with him. The peroration was magnificent, though difficult to remember, you
1756@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@know. It gave me the notion of an exotic Immensity ruled by an august
1757@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@Benevolence. It made me tingle with enthusiasm. This was the unbounded power of
1758@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@eloquence—of words—of burning noble words. There were no practical hints to
1759@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@interrupt the magic current of phrases, unless a kind of note at the foot of the
1760@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@last page, scrawled evidently much later, in an unsteady hand, may be regarded
1761@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@as the exposition of a method. It was very simple, and at the end of that moving
1762@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@appeal to every altruistic sentiment it blazed at you, luminous and terrifying,
1763@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@like a flash of lightning in a serene sky: ‘Exterminate all the brutes!’ The
1764@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@curious part was that he had apparently forgotten all about that valuable
1765@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@postscriptum, because, later on, when he in a sense came to himself, he
1766@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@repeatedly entreated me to take good care of ‘my pamphlet’ (he called it), as it
1767@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@was sure to have in the future a good influence upon his career. I had full
1768@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@information about all these things, and, besides, as it turned out, I was to
1769@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@have the care of his memory. I’ve done enough for it to give me the indisputable
1770@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@right to lay it, if I choose, for an everlasting rest in the dust-bin of
1771@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@progress, amongst all the sweepings and, figuratively speaking, all the dead
1772@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@cats of civilization. But then, you see, I can’t choose. He won’t be forgotten.
1773@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@Whatever he was, he was not common. He had the power to charm or frighten
1774@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@rudimentary souls into an aggravated witch-dance in his honour; he could also
1775@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@fill the small souls of the pilgrims with bitter misgivings: he had one devoted
1776@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@friend at least, and he had conquered one soul in the world that was neither
1777@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@rudimentary nor tainted with self-seeking. No; I can’t forget him, though I am
1778@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@not prepared to affirm the fellow was exactly worth the life we lost in getting
1779@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@to him.  I missed my late helmsman awfully—I missed him even while his body was
1780@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@still lying in the pilot-house. Perhaps you will think it passing strange this
1781@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@regret for a savage who was no more account than a grain of sand in a black
1782@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@Sahara. Well, don’t you see, he had done something, he had steered; for months I
1783@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@had him at my back—a help—an instrument. It was a kind of partnership. He
1784@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@steered for me—I had to look after him, I worried about his deficiencies, and
1785@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@thus a subtle bond had been created, of which I only became aware when it was
1786@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@suddenly broken. And the intimate profundity of that look he gave me when he
1787@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@received his hurt remains to this day in my memory—like a claim of distant
1788@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@kinship affirmed in a supreme moment.
1789@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@“Poor fool! If he had only left that shutter alone. He had no restraint, no
1790@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@restraint—just like Kurtz—a tree swayed by the wind. As soon as I had put on a
1791@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@dry pair of slippers, I dragged him out, after first jerking the spear out of
1792@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@his side, which operation I confess I performed with my eyes shut tight. His
1793@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@heels leaped together over the little doorstep; his shoulders were pressed to my
1794@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@breast; I hugged him from behind desperately. Oh! he was heavy, heavy; heavier
1795@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@than any man on earth, I should imagine. Then without more ado I tipped him
1796@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@overboard. The current snatched him as though he had been a wisp of grass, and I
1797@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@saw the body roll over twice before I lost sight of it for ever. All the
1798@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@pilgrims and the manager were then congregated on the awning-deck about the
1799@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@pilot-house, chattering at each other like a flock of excited magpies, and there
1800@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@was a scandalized murmur at my heartless promptitude. What they wanted to keep
1801@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@that body hanging about for I can’t guess. Embalm it, maybe. But I had also
1802@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@heard another, and a very ominous, murmur on the deck below. My friends the
1803@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@wood-cutters were likewise scandalized, and with a better show of reason—though
1804@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@I admit that the reason itself was quite inadmissible. Oh, quite! I had made up
1805@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@my mind that if my late helmsman was to be eaten, the fishes alone should have
1806@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@him. He had been a very second-rate helmsman while alive, but now he was dead he
1807@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@might have become a first-class temptation, and possibly cause some startling
1808@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@trouble. Besides, I was anxious to take the wheel, the man in pink pyjamas
1809@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@showing himself a hopeless duffer at the business.
1810@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@“This I did directly the simple funeral was over. We were going half-speed,
1811@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@keeping right in the middle of the stream, and I listened to the talk about me.
1812@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@They had given up Kurtz, they had given up the station; Kurtz was dead, and the
1813@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@station had been burnt—and so on—and so on. The red-haired pilgrim was beside
1814@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@himself with the thought that at least this poor Kurtz had been properly
1815@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@avenged. ‘Say! We must have made a glorious slaughter of them in the bush. Eh?
1816@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@What do you think? Say?’ He positively danced, the bloodthirsty little gingery
1817@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@beggar. And he had nearly fainted when he saw the wounded man! I could not help
1818@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@saying, ‘You made a glorious lot of smoke, anyhow.’ I had seen, from the way the
1819@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@tops of the bushes rustled and flew, that almost all the shots had gone too
1820@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@high. You can’t hit anything unless you take aim and fire from the shoulder; but
1821@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@these chaps fired from the hip with their eyes shut. The retreat, I
1822@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@maintained—and I was right—was caused by the screeching of the steam whistle.
1823@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@Upon this they forgot Kurtz, and began to howl at me with indignant protests.
1824@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@“The manager stood by the wheel murmuring confidentially about the necessity of
1825@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@getting well away down the river before dark at all events, when I saw in the
1826@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@distance a clearing on the riverside and the outlines of some sort of building.
1827@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@‘What’s this?’ I asked. He clapped his hands in wonder. ‘The station!’ he cried.
1828@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@I edged in at once, still going half-speed.
1829@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@“Through my glasses I saw the slope of a hill interspersed with rare trees and
1830@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@perfectly free from undergrowth. A long decaying building on the summit was half
1831@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@buried in the high grass; the large holes in the peaked roof gaped black from
1832@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@afar; the jungle and the woods made a background. There was no enclosure or
1833@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@fence of any kind; but there had been one apparently, for near the house
1834@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@half-a-dozen slim posts remained in a row, roughly trimmed, and with their upper
1835@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@ends ornamented with round carved balls. The rails, or whatever there had been
1836@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@between, had disappeared. Of course the forest surrounded all that. The
1837@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@river-bank was clear, and on the waterside I saw a white man under a hat like a
1838@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@cart-wheel beckoning persistently with his whole arm. Examining the edge of the
1839@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@forest above and below, I was almost certain I could see movements—human forms
1840@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@gliding here and there. I steamed past prudently, then stopped the engines and
1841@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@let her drift down. The man on the shore began to shout, urging us to land. ‘We
1842@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@have been attacked,’ screamed the manager. ‘I know—I know. It’s all right,’
1843@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@yelled back the other, as cheerful as you please. ‘Come along. It’s all right. I
1844@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@am glad.’
1845@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@“His aspect reminded me of something I had seen—something funny I had seen
1846@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@somewhere. As I manoeuvred to get alongside, I was asking myself, ’What does
1847@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@this fellow look like?’ Suddenly I got it. He looked like a harlequin.  His
1848@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@clothes had been made of some stuff that was brown holland probably, but it was
1849@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@covered with patches all over, with bright patches, blue, red, and
1850@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@yellow—patches on the back, patches on the front, patches on elbows, on knees;
1851@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@coloured binding around his jacket, scarlet edging at the bottom of his
1852@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@trousers; and the sunshine made him look extremely gay and wonderfully neat
1853@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@withal, because you could see how beautifully all this patching had been done. A
1854@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@beardless, boyish face, very fair, no features to speak of, nose peeling, little
1855@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@blue eyes, smiles and frowns chasing each other over that open countenance like
1856@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@sunshine and shadow on a wind-swept plain. ‘Look out, captain!’ he cried;
1857@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@‘there’s a snag lodged in here last night.’ What!  Another snag? I confess I
1858@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@swore shamefully. I had nearly holed my cripple, to finish off that charming
1859@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@trip. The harlequin on the bank turned his little pug-nose up to me. ‘You
1860@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@English?’ he asked, all smiles. ‘Are you?’ I shouted from the wheel. The smiles
1861@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@vanished, and he shook his head as if sorry for my disappointment. Then he
1862@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@brightened up. ‘Never mind!’ he cried encouragingly. ‘Are we in time?’ I asked.
1863@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@‘He is up there,’ he replied, with a toss of the head up the hill, and becoming
1864@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@gloomy all of a sudden.  His face was like the autumn sky, overcast one moment
1865@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@and bright the next.
1866@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@“When the manager, escorted by the pilgrims, all of them armed to the teeth, had
1867@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@gone to the house this chap came on board. ‘I say, I don’t like this. These
1868@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@natives are in the bush,’ I said. He assured me earnestly it was all right.
1869@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@‘They are simple people,’ he added; ‘well, I am glad you came. It took me all my
1870@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@time to keep them off.’ ‘But you said it was all right,’ I cried. ‘Oh, they
1871@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@meant no harm,’ he said; and as I stared he corrected himself, ‘Not exactly.’
1872@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@Then vivaciously, ‘My faith, your pilot-house wants a clean-up!’ In the next
1873@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@breath he advised me to keep enough steam on the boiler to blow the whistle in
1874@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@case of any trouble. ‘One good screech will do more for you than all your
1875@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@rifles. They are simple people,’ he repeated. He rattled away at such a rate he
1876@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@quite overwhelmed me. He seemed to be trying to make up for lots of silence, and
1877@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@actually hinted, laughing, that such was the case. ‘Don’t you talk with Mr.
1878@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@Kurtz?’ I said. ‘You don’t talk with that man—you listen to him,’ he exclaimed
1879@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@with severe exaltation. ‘But now—’ He waved his arm, and in the twinkling of an
1880@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@eye was in the uttermost depths of despondency. In a moment he came up again
1881@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@with a jump, possessed himself of both my hands, shook them continuously, while
1882@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@he gabbled: ‘Brother sailor... honour... pleasure...  delight... introduce
1883@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@myself... Russian... son of an arch-priest...  Government of Tambov... What?
1884@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@Tobacco! English tobacco; the excellent English tobacco! Now, that’s brotherly.
1885@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@Smoke? Where’s a sailor that does not smoke?”
1886@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@“The pipe soothed him, and gradually I made out he had run away from school, had
1887@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@gone to sea in a Russian ship; ran away again; served some time in English
1888@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@ships; was now reconciled with the arch-priest. He made a point of that. ‘But
1889@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@when one is young one must see things, gather experience, ideas; enlarge the
1890@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@mind.’ ‘Here!’ I interrupted. ‘You can never tell! Here I met Mr. Kurtz,’ he
1891@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@said, youthfully solemn and reproachful. I held my tongue after that. It appears
1892@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@he had persuaded a Dutch trading-house on the coast to fit him out with stores
1893@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@and goods, and had started for the interior with a light heart and no more idea
1894@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@of what would happen to him than a baby. He had been wandering about that river
1895@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@for nearly two years alone, cut off from everybody and everything. ’I am not so
1896@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@young as I look. I am twenty-five,’ he said. ‘At first old Van Shuyten would
1897@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@tell me to go to the devil,’ he narrated with keen enjoyment; ‘but I stuck to
1898@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@him, and talked and talked, till at last he got afraid I would talk the hind-leg
1899@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@off his favourite dog, so he gave me some cheap things and a few guns, and told
1900@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@me he hoped he would never see my face again. Good old Dutchman, Van Shuyten.
1901@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@I’ve sent him one small lot of ivory a year ago, so that he can’t call me a
1902@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@little thief when I get back. I hope he got it. And for the rest I don’t care. I
1903@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@had some wood stacked for you. That was my old house. Did you see?’
1904@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@“I gave him Towson’s book. He made as though he would kiss me, but restrained
1905@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@himself. ‘The only book I had left, and I thought I had lost it,’ he said,
1906@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@looking at it ecstatically. ‘So many accidents happen to a man going about
1907@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@alone, you know. Canoes get upset sometimes—and sometimes you’ve got to clear
1908@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@out so quick when the people get angry.’ He thumbed the pages. ‘You made notes
1909@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@in Russian?’ I asked. He nodded. ’I thought they were written in cipher,’ I
1910@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@said. He laughed, then became serious. ‘I had lots of trouble to keep these
1911@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@people off,’ he said. ’Did they want to kill you?’ I asked. ‘Oh, no!’ he cried,
1912@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@and checked himself. ‘Why did they attack us?’ I pursued. He hesitated, then
1913@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@said shamefacedly, ‘They don’t want him to go.’ ‘Don’t they?’ I said curiously.
1914@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@He nodded a nod full of mystery and wisdom. ‘I tell you,’ he cried, ‘this man
1915@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@has enlarged my mind.’ He opened his arms wide, staring at me with his little
1916@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@2@0@0@0@blue eyes that were perfectly round.”
1917@lvl1>Chapter@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@III
1918@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“I looked at him, lost in astonishment. There he was before me, in motley, as
1919@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@though he had absconded from a troupe of mimes, enthusiastic, fabulous.  His
1920@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@very existence was improbable, inexplicable, and altogether bewildering. He was
1921@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@an insoluble problem. It was inconceivable how he had existed, how he had
1922@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@succeeded in getting so far, how he had managed to remain—why he did not
1923@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@instantly disappear. ’I went a little farther,’ he said, ‘then still a little
1924@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@farther—till I had gone so far that I don’t know how I’ll ever get back. Never
1925@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@mind. Plenty time. I can manage. You take Kurtz away quick—quick—I tell you.’
1926@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@The glamour of youth enveloped his parti-coloured rags, his destitution, his
1927@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@loneliness, the essential desolation of his futile wanderings. For months—for
1928@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@years—his life hadn’t been worth a day’s purchase; and there he was gallantly,
1929@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@thoughtlessly alive, to all appearances indestructible solely by the virtue of
1930@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@his few years and of his unreflecting audacity. I was seduced into something
1931@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@like admiration—like envy. Glamour urged him on, glamour kept him unscathed. He
1932@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@surely wanted nothing from the wilderness but space to breathe in and to push on
1933@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@through. His need was to exist, and to move onwards at the greatest possible
1934@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@risk, and with a maximum of privation. If the absolutely pure, uncalculating,
1935@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@unpractical spirit of adventure had ever ruled a human being, it ruled this
1936@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@bepatched youth. I almost envied him the possession of this modest and clear
1937@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@flame. It seemed to have consumed all thought of self so completely, that even
1938@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@while he was talking to you, you forgot that it was he—the man before your
1939@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@eyes—who had gone through these things. I did not envy him his devotion to
1940@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@Kurtz, though. He had not meditated over it.  It came to him, and he accepted it
1941@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@with a sort of eager fatalism. I must say that to me it appeared about the most
1942@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@dangerous thing in every way he had come upon so far.
1943@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“They had come together unavoidably, like two ships becalmed near each other,
1944@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@and lay rubbing sides at last. I suppose Kurtz wanted an audience, because on a
1945@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@certain occasion, when encamped in the forest, they had talked all night, or
1946@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@more probably Kurtz had talked. ‘We talked of everything,’ he said, quite
1947@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@transported at the recollection. ‘I forgot there was such a thing as sleep. The
1948@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@night did not seem to last an hour. Everything!  Everything!... Of love, too.’
1949@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@‘Ah, he talked to you of love!’ I said, much amused. ‘It isn’t what you think,’
1950@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@he cried, almost passionately. ‘It was in general. He made me see
1951@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@things—things.’
1952@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“He threw his arms up. We were on deck at the time, and the headman of my
1953@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@wood-cutters, lounging near by, turned upon him his heavy and glittering eyes. I
1954@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@looked around, and I don’t know why, but I assure you that never, never before,
1955@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@did this land, this river, this jungle, the very arch of this blazing sky,
1956@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@appear to me so hopeless and so dark, so impenetrable to human thought, so
1957@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@pitiless to human weakness. ‘And, ever since, you have been with him, of
1958@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@course?’ I said.
1959@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“On the contrary. It appears their intercourse had been very much broken by
1960@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@various causes. He had, as he informed me proudly, managed to nurse Kurtz
1961@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@through two illnesses (he alluded to it as you would to some risky feat), but as
1962@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@a rule Kurtz wandered alone, far in the depths of the forest. ‘Very often coming
1963@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@to this station, I had to wait days and days before he would turn up,’ he said.
1964@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@‘Ah, it was worth waiting for!—sometimes.’ ‘What was he doing? exploring or
1965@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@what?’ I asked. ‘Oh, yes, of course’; he had discovered lots of villages, a
1966@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@lake, too—he did not know exactly in what direction; it was dangerous to inquire
1967@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@too much—but mostly his expeditions had been for ivory. ‘But he had no goods to
1968@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@trade with by that time,’ I objected.  ‘There’s a good lot of cartridges left
1969@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@even yet,’ he answered, looking away. ‘To speak plainly, he raided the country,’
1970@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@I said. He nodded. ‘Not alone, surely!’ He muttered something about the villages
1971@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@round that lake.  ‘Kurtz got the tribe to follow him, did he?’ I suggested. He
1972@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@fidgeted a little. ‘They adored him,’ he said. The tone of these words was so
1973@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@extraordinary that I looked at him searchingly. It was curious to see his
1974@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@mingled eagerness and reluctance to speak of Kurtz. The man filled his life,
1975@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@occupied his thoughts, swayed his emotions. ‘What can you expect?’ he burst out;
1976@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@‘he came to them with thunder and lightning, you know—and they had never seen
1977@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@anything like it—and very terrible. He could be very terrible. You can’t judge
1978@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@Mr. Kurtz as you would an ordinary man. No, no, no! Now—just to give you an
1979@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@idea—I don’t mind telling you, he wanted to shoot me, too, one day—but I don’t
1980@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@judge him.’ ‘Shoot you!’ I cried ’What for?’ ‘Well, I had a small lot of ivory
1981@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@the chief of that village near my house gave me. You see I used to shoot game
1982@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@for them. Well, he wanted it, and wouldn’t hear reason. He declared he would
1983@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@shoot me unless I gave him the ivory and then cleared out of the country,
1984@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@because he could do so, and had a fancy for it, and there was nothing on earth
1985@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@to prevent him killing whom he jolly well pleased. And it was true, too. I gave
1986@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@him the ivory.  What did I care! But I didn’t clear out. No, no. I couldn’t
1987@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@leave him.  I had to be careful, of course, till we got friendly again for a
1988@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@time. He had his second illness then. Afterwards I had to keep out of the way;
1989@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@but I didn’t mind. He was living for the most part in those villages on the
1990@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@lake. When he came down to the river, sometimes he would take to me, and
1991@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@sometimes it was better for me to be careful. This man suffered too much.  He
1992@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@hated all this, and somehow he couldn’t get away. When I had a chance I begged
1993@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@him to try and leave while there was time; I offered to go back with him. And he
1994@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@would say yes, and then he would remain; go off on another ivory hunt; disappear
1995@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@for weeks; forget himself amongst these people—forget himself—you know.’ ‘Why!
1996@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@he’s mad,’ I said. He protested indignantly. Mr.  Kurtz couldn’t be mad. If I
1997@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@had heard him talk, only two days ago, I wouldn’t dare hint at such a thing....
1998@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@I had taken up my binoculars while we talked, and was looking at the shore,
1999@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@sweeping the limit of the forest at each side and at the back of the house. The
2000@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@consciousness of there being people in that bush, so silent, so quiet—as silent
2001@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@and quiet as the ruined house on the hill—made me uneasy. There was no sign on
2002@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@the face of nature of this amazing tale that was not so much told as suggested
2003@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@to me in desolate exclamations, completed by shrugs, in interrupted phrases, in
2004@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@hints ending in deep sighs. The woods were unmoved, like a mask—heavy, like the
2005@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@closed door of a prison—they looked with their air of hidden knowledge, of
2006@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@patient expectation, of unapproachable silence. The Russian was explaining to me
2007@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@that it was only lately that Mr. Kurtz had come down to the river, bringing
2008@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@along with him all the fighting men of that lake tribe.  He had been absent for
2009@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@several months—getting himself adored, I suppose—and had come down unexpectedly,
2010@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@with the intention to all appearance of making a raid either across the river or
2011@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@down stream. Evidently the appetite for more ivory had got the better of
2012@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@the—what shall I say?—less material aspirations. However he had got much worse
2013@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@suddenly. ‘I heard he was lying helpless, and so I came up—took my chance,’ said
2014@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@the Russian. ‘Oh, he is bad, very bad.’ I directed my glass to the house. There
2015@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@were no signs of life, but there was the ruined roof, the long mud wall peeping
2016@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@above the grass, with three little square window-holes, no two of the same size;
2017@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@all this brought within reach of my hand, as it were. And then I made a brusque
2018@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@movement, and one of the remaining posts of that vanished fence leaped up in the
2019@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@field of my glass. You remember I told you I had been struck at the distance by
2020@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@certain attempts at ornamentation, rather remarkable in the ruinous aspect of
2021@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@the place. Now I had suddenly a nearer view, and its first result was to make me
2022@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@throw my head back as if before a blow. Then I went carefully from post to post
2023@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@with my glass, and I saw my mistake.  These round knobs were not ornamental but
2024@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@symbolic; they were expressive and puzzling, striking and disturbing—food for
2025@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@thought and also for vultures if there had been any looking down from the sky;
2026@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@but at all events for such ants as were industrious enough to ascend the pole.
2027@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@They would have been even more impressive, those heads on the stakes, if their
2028@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@faces had not been turned to the house. Only one, the first I had made out, was
2029@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@facing my way. I was not so shocked as you may think. The start back I had given
2030@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@was really nothing but a movement of surprise. I had expected to see a knob of
2031@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@wood there, you know. I returned deliberately to the first I had seen—and there
2032@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@it was, black, dried, sunken, with closed eyelids—a head that seemed to sleep at
2033@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@the top of that pole, and, with the shrunken dry lips showing a narrow white
2034@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@line of the teeth, was smiling, too, smiling continuously at some endless and
2035@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@jocose dream of that eternal slumber.
2036@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“I am not disclosing any trade secrets. In fact, the manager said afterwards
2037@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@that Mr. Kurtz’s methods had ruined the district. I have no opinion on that
2038@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@point, but I want you clearly to understand that there was nothing exactly
2039@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@profitable in these heads being there. They only showed that Mr. Kurtz lacked
2040@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@restraint in the gratification of his various lusts, that there was something
2041@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@wanting in him—some small matter which, when the pressing need arose, could not
2042@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@be found under his magnificent eloquence.  Whether he knew of this deficiency
2043@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@himself I can’t say. I think the knowledge came to him at last—only at the very
2044@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@last. But the wilderness had found him out early, and had taken on him a
2045@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@terrible vengeance for the fantastic invasion. I think it had whispered to him
2046@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@things about himself which he did not know, things of which he had no conception
2047@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@till he took counsel with this great solitude—and the whisper had proved
2048@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@irresistibly fascinating. It echoed loudly within him because he was hollow at
2049@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@the core.... I put down the glass, and the head that had appeared near enough to
2050@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@be spoken to seemed at once to have leaped away from me into inaccessible
2051@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@distance.
2052@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“The admirer of Mr. Kurtz was a bit crestfallen. In a hurried, indistinct voice
2053@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@he began to assure me he had not dared to take these—say, symbols—down. He was
2054@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@not afraid of the natives; they would not stir till Mr. Kurtz gave the word. His
2055@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@ascendancy was extraordinary. The camps of these people surrounded the place,
2056@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@and the chiefs came every day to see him. They would crawl.... ‘I don’t want to
2057@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@know anything of the ceremonies used when approaching Mr. Kurtz,’ I shouted.
2058@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@Curious, this feeling that came over me that such details would be more
2059@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@intolerable than those heads drying on the stakes under Mr. Kurtz’s windows.
2060@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@After all, that was only a savage sight, while I seemed at one bound to have
2061@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@been transported into some lightless region of subtle horrors, where pure,
2062@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@uncomplicated savagery was a positive relief, being something that had a right
2063@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@to exist—obviously—in the sunshine. The young man looked at me with surprise.  I
2064@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@suppose it did not occur to him that Mr. Kurtz was no idol of mine. He forgot I
2065@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@hadn’t heard any of these splendid monologues on, what was it? on love, justice,
2066@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@conduct of life—or what not. If it had come to crawling before Mr. Kurtz, he
2067@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@crawled as much as the veriest savage of them all.  I had no idea of the
2068@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@conditions, he said: these heads were the heads of rebels. I shocked him
2069@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@excessively by laughing. Rebels! What would be the next definition I was to
2070@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@hear? There had been enemies, criminals, workers—and these were rebels. Those
2071@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@rebellious heads looked very subdued to me on their sticks. ‘You don’t know how
2072@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@such a life tries a man like Kurtz,’ cried Kurtz’s last disciple. ‘Well, and
2073@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@you?’ I said. ‘I! I! I am a simple man. I have no great thoughts. I want nothing
2074@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@from anybody. How can you compare me to...?’ His feelings were too much for
2075@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@speech, and suddenly he broke down. ‘I don’t understand,’ he groaned. ‘I’ve been
2076@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@doing my best to keep him alive, and that’s enough. I had no hand in all this.
2077@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@I have no abilities. There hasn’t been a drop of medicine or a mouthful of
2078@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@invalid food for months here. He was shamefully abandoned. A man like this, with
2079@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@such ideas. Shamefully! Shamefully! I—I—haven’t slept for the last ten
2080@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@nights...’
2081@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“His voice lost itself in the calm of the evening. The long shadows of the
2082@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@forest had slipped downhill while we talked, had gone far beyond the ruined
2083@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@hovel, beyond the symbolic row of stakes. All this was in the gloom, while we
2084@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@down there were yet in the sunshine, and the stretch of the river abreast of the
2085@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@clearing glittered in a still and dazzling splendour, with a murky and
2086@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@overshadowed bend above and below. Not a living soul was seen on the shore. The
2087@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@bushes did not rustle.
2088@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“Suddenly round the corner of the house a group of men appeared, as though they
2089@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@had come up from the ground. They waded waist-deep in the grass, in a compact
2090@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@body, bearing an improvised stretcher in their midst. Instantly, in the
2091@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@emptiness of the landscape, a cry arose whose shrillness pierced the still air
2092@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@like a sharp arrow flying straight to the very heart of the land; and, as if by
2093@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@enchantment, streams of human beings—of naked human beings—with spears in their
2094@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@hands, with bows, with shields, with wild glances and savage movements, were
2095@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@poured into the clearing by the dark-faced and pensive forest. The bushes shook,
2096@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@the grass swayed for a time, and then everything stood still in attentive
2097@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@immobility.
2098@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“‘Now, if he does not say the right thing to them we are all done for,’ said the
2099@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@Russian at my elbow. The knot of men with the stretcher had stopped, too,
2100@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@halfway to the steamer, as if petrified. I saw the man on the stretcher sit up,
2101@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@lank and with an uplifted arm, above the shoulders of the bearers. ‘Let us hope
2102@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@that the man who can talk so well of love in general will find some particular
2103@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@reason to spare us this time,’ I said. I resented bitterly the absurd danger of
2104@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@our situation, as if to be at the mercy of that atrocious phantom had been a
2105@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@dishonouring necessity. I could not hear a sound, but through my glasses I saw
2106@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@the thin arm extended commandingly, the lower jaw moving, the eyes of that
2107@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@apparition shining darkly far in its bony head that nodded with grotesque jerks.
2108@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@Kurtz—Kurtz—that means short in German—don’t it? Well, the name was as true as
2109@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@everything else in his life—and death. He looked at least seven feet long. His
2110@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@covering had fallen off, and his body emerged from it pitiful and appalling as
2111@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@from a winding-sheet. I could see the cage of his ribs all astir, the bones of
2112@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@his arm waving. It was as though an animated image of death carved out of old
2113@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@ivory had been shaking its hand with menaces at a motionless crowd of men made
2114@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@of dark and glittering bronze. I saw him open his mouth wide—it gave him a
2115@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@weirdly voracious aspect, as though he had wanted to swallow all the air, all
2116@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@the earth, all the men before him. A deep voice reached me faintly. He must have
2117@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@been shouting. He fell back suddenly. The stretcher shook as the bearers
2118@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@staggered forward again, and almost at the same time I noticed that the crowd of
2119@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@savages was vanishing without any perceptible movement of retreat, as if the
2120@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@forest that had ejected these beings so suddenly had drawn them in again as the
2121@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@breath is drawn in a long aspiration.
2122@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“Some of the pilgrims behind the stretcher carried his arms—two shot-guns, a
2123@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@heavy rifle, and a light revolver-carbine—the thunderbolts of that pitiful
2124@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@Jupiter. The manager bent over him murmuring as he walked beside his head. They
2125@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@laid him down in one of the little cabins—just a room for a bed place and a
2126@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@camp-stool or two, you know. We had brought his belated correspondence, and a
2127@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@lot of torn envelopes and open letters littered his bed. His hand roamed feebly
2128@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@amongst these papers. I was struck by the fire of his eyes and the composed
2129@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@languor of his expression. It was not so much the exhaustion of disease. He did
2130@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@not seem in pain. This shadow looked satiated and calm, as though for the moment
2131@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@it had had its fill of all the emotions.
2132@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“He rustled one of the letters, and looking straight in my face said, ’I am
2133@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@glad.’ Somebody had been writing to him about me. These special recommendations
2134@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@were turning up again. The volume of tone he emitted without effort, almost
2135@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@without the trouble of moving his lips, amazed me.  A voice! a voice! It was
2136@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@grave, profound, vibrating, while the man did not seem capable of a whisper.
2137@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@However, he had enough strength in him—factitious no doubt—to very nearly make
2138@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@an end of us, as you shall hear directly.
2139@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“The manager appeared silently in the doorway; I stepped out at once and he drew
2140@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@the curtain after me. The Russian, eyed curiously by the pilgrims, was staring
2141@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@at the shore. I followed the direction of his glance.
2142@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“Dark human shapes could be made out in the distance, flitting indistinctly
2143@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@against the gloomy border of the forest, and near the river two bronze figures,
2144@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@leaning on tall spears, stood in the sunlight under fantastic head-dresses of
2145@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@spotted skins, warlike and still in statuesque repose. And from right to left
2146@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@along the lighted shore moved a wild and gorgeous apparition of a woman.
2147@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“She walked with measured steps, draped in striped and fringed cloths, treading
2148@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@the earth proudly, with a slight jingle and flash of barbarous ornaments. She
2149@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@carried her head high; her hair was done in the shape of a helmet; she had brass
2150@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@leggings to the knee, brass wire gauntlets to the elbow, a crimson spot on her
2151@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@tawny cheek, innumerable necklaces of glass beads on her neck; bizarre things,
2152@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@charms, gifts of witch-men, that hung about her, glittered and trembled at every
2153@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@step. She must have had the value of several elephant tusks upon her. She was
2154@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@savage and superb, wild-eyed and magnificent; there was something ominous and
2155@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@stately in her deliberate progress. And in the hush that had fallen suddenly
2156@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@upon the whole sorrowful land, the immense wilderness, the colossal body of the
2157@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@fecund and mysterious life seemed to look at her, pensive, as though it had been
2158@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@looking at the image of its own tenebrous and passionate soul.
2159@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“She came abreast of the steamer, stood still, and faced us. Her long shadow
2160@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@fell to the water’s edge. Her face had a tragic and fierce aspect of wild sorrow
2161@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@and of dumb pain mingled with the fear of some struggling, half-shaped resolve.
2162@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@She stood looking at us without a stir, and like the wilderness itself, with an
2163@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@air of brooding over an inscrutable purpose.  A whole minute passed, and then
2164@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@she made a step forward. There was a low jingle, a glint of yellow metal, a sway
2165@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@of fringed draperies, and she stopped as if her heart had failed her. The young
2166@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@fellow by my side growled. The pilgrims murmured at my back. She looked at us
2167@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@all as if her life had depended upon the unswerving steadiness of her glance.
2168@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@Suddenly she opened her bared arms and threw them up rigid above her head, as
2169@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@though in an uncontrollable desire to touch the sky, and at the same time the
2170@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@swift shadows darted out on the earth, swept around on the river, gathering the
2171@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@steamer into a shadowy embrace. A formidable silence hung over the scene.
2172@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“She turned away slowly, walked on, following the bank, and passed into the
2173@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@bushes to the left. Once only her eyes gleamed back at us in the dusk of the
2174@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@thickets before she disappeared.
2175@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“‘If she had offered to come aboard I really think I would have tried to shoot
2176@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@her,’ said the man of patches, nervously. ‘I have been risking my life every day
2177@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@for the last fortnight to keep her out of the house. She got in one day and
2178@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@kicked up a row about those miserable rags I picked up in the storeroom to mend

2180@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@talked like a fury to Kurtz for an hour, pointing at me now and then. I don’t

2191@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@aside. ‘He is very low, very low,’ he said. He considered it necessary to sigh,
2192@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@but neglected to be consistently sorrowful. ‘We have done all we could for

2195@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@action. Cautiously, cautiously—that’s my principle. We must be cautious yet. The
2196@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@district is closed to us for a time. Deplorable! Upon the whole, the trade will
2197@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@suffer. I don’t deny there is a remarkable quantity of ivory—mostly fossil. We
2198@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@must save it, at all events—but look how precarious the position is—and why?
2199@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@Because the method is unsound.’ ‘Do you,’ said I, looking at the shore, ‘call it
2200@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@”unsound method?“’ ‘Without doubt,’ he exclaimed hotly. ‘Don’t you?’... ‘No
2201@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@method at all,’ I murmured after a while. ‘Exactly,’ he exulted. ‘I anticipated
2202@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@this. Shows a complete want of judgment. It is my duty to point it out in the
2203@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@proper quarter.’ ’Oh,’ said I, ‘that fellow—what’s his name?—the brickmaker,
2204@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@will make a readable report for you.’ He appeared confounded for a moment. It
2205@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@seemed to me I had never breathed an atmosphere so vile, and I turned mentally
2206@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@to Kurtz for relief—positively for relief.  ‘Nevertheless I think Mr. Kurtz is a
2207@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@remarkable man,’ I said with emphasis.  He started, dropped on me a heavy
2208@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@glance, said very quietly, ‘he _was_,’ and turned his back on me. My hour of
2209@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@favour was over; I found myself lumped along with Kurtz as a partisan of methods
2210@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@for which the time was not ripe: I was unsound! Ah! but it was something to have
2211@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@at least a choice of nightmares.
2212@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“I had turned to the wilderness really, not to Mr. Kurtz, who, I was ready to
2213@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@admit, was as good as buried. And for a moment it seemed to me as if I also were
2214@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@buried in a vast grave full of unspeakable secrets. I felt an intolerable weight
2215@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@oppressing my breast, the smell of the damp earth, the unseen presence of
2216@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@victorious corruption, the darkness of an impenetrable night.... The Russian
2217@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@tapped me on the shoulder. I heard him mumbling and stammering something about
2218@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@‘brother seaman—couldn’t conceal—knowledge of matters that would affect Mr.
2219@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@Kurtz’s reputation.’ I waited. For him evidently Mr. Kurtz was not in his grave;
2220@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@I suspect that for him Mr. Kurtz was one of the immortals. ‘Well!’ said I at
2221@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@last, ‘speak out. As it happens, I am Mr. Kurtz’s friend—in a way.’
2222@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“He stated with a good deal of formality that had we not been ‘of the same
2223@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@profession,’ he would have kept the matter to himself without regard to
2224@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@consequences. ‘He suspected there was an active ill-will towards him on the part
2225@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@of these white men that—’ ‘You are right,’ I said, remembering a certain
2226@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@conversation I had overheard. ‘The manager thinks you ought to be hanged.’ He
2227@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@showed a concern at this intelligence which amused me at first.  ‘I had better
2228@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@get out of the way quietly,’ he said earnestly. ‘I can do no more for Kurtz now,
2229@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@and they would soon find some excuse. What’s to stop them? There’s a military
2230@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@post three hundred miles from here.’ ‘Well, upon my word,’ said I, ‘perhaps you
2231@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@had better go if you have any friends amongst the savages near by.’ ’Plenty,’ he
2232@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@said. ‘They are simple people—and I want nothing, you know.’ He stood biting his
2233@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@lip, then: ‘I don’t want any harm to happen to these whites here, but of course
2234@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@I was thinking of Mr. Kurtz’s reputation—but you are a brother seaman and—’ ‘All
2235@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@right,’ said I, after a time. ‘Mr. Kurtz’s reputation is safe with me.’ I did
2236@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@not know how truly I spoke.
2237@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“He informed me, lowering his voice, that it was Kurtz who had ordered the
2238@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@attack to be made on the steamer. ‘He hated sometimes the idea of being taken
2239@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@away—and then again.... But I don’t understand these matters. I am a simple man.
2240@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@He thought it would scare you away—that you would give it up, thinking him dead.
2241@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@I could not stop him. Oh, I had an awful time of it this last month.’ ‘Very
2242@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@well,’ I said. ‘He is all right now.’ ‘Ye-e-es,’ he muttered, not very convinced
2243@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@apparently. ‘Thanks,’ said I; ‘I shall keep my eyes open.’ ‘But quiet-eh?’ he
2244@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@urged anxiously. ’It would be awful for his reputation if anybody here—’ I
2245@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@promised a complete discretion with great gravity. ‘I have a canoe and three
2246@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@black fellows waiting not very far. I am off. Could you give me a few
2247@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@Martini-Henry cartridges?’ I could, and did, with proper secrecy. He helped
2248@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@himself, with a wink at me, to a handful of my tobacco. ‘Between sailors—you
2249@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@know—good English tobacco.’ At the door of the pilot-house he turned round—‘I
2250@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@say, haven’t you a pair of shoes you could spare?’ He raised one leg. ‘Look.’
2251@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@The soles were tied with knotted strings sandalwise under his bare feet. I
2252@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@rooted out an old pair, at which he looked with admiration before tucking it
2253@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@under his left arm. One of his pockets (bright red) was bulging with cartridges,
2254@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@from the other (dark blue) peeped ‘Towson’s Inquiry,’ etc., etc. He seemed to
2255@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@think himself excellently well equipped for a renewed encounter with the
2256@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@wilderness.  ’Ah! I’ll never, never meet such a man again. You ought to have
2257@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@heard him recite poetry—his own, too, it was, he told me. Poetry!’ He rolled his
2258@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@eyes at the recollection of these delights. ‘Oh, he enlarged my mind!’
2259@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@‘Good-bye,’ said I. He shook hands and vanished in the night. Sometimes I ask
2260@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@myself whether I had ever really seen him—whether it was possible to meet such a
2261@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@phenomenon!...
2262@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“When I woke up shortly after midnight his warning came to my mind with its hint
2263@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@of danger that seemed, in the starred darkness, real enough to make me get up
2264@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@for the purpose of having a look round. On the hill a big fire burned,
2265@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@illuminating fitfully a crooked corner of the station-house. One of the agents
2266@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@with a picket of a few of our blacks, armed for the purpose, was keeping guard
2267@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@over the ivory; but deep within the forest, red gleams that wavered, that seemed
2268@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@to sink and rise from the ground amongst confused columnar shapes of intense
2269@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@blackness, showed the exact position of the camp where Mr. Kurtz’s adorers were
2270@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@keeping their uneasy vigil. The monotonous beating of a big drum filled the air
2271@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@with muffled shocks and a lingering vibration. A steady droning sound of many
2272@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@men chanting each to himself some weird incantation came out from the black,
2273@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@flat wall of the woods as the humming of bees comes out of a hive, and had a
2274@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@strange narcotic effect upon my half-awake senses. I believe I dozed off leaning
2275@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@over the rail, till an abrupt burst of yells, an overwhelming outbreak of a
2276@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@pent-up and mysterious frenzy, woke me up in a bewildered wonder. It was cut
2277@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@short all at once, and the low droning went on with an effect of audible and
2278@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@soothing silence.  I glanced casually into the little cabin. A light was burning
2279@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@within, but Mr. Kurtz was not there.
2280@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“I think I would have raised an outcry if I had believed my eyes. But I didn’t
2281@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@believe them at first—the thing seemed so impossible. The fact is I was
2282@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@completely unnerved by a sheer blank fright, pure abstract terror, unconnected
2283@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@with any distinct shape of physical danger. What made this emotion so
2284@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@overpowering was—how shall I define it?—the moral shock I received, as if
2285@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@something altogether monstrous, intolerable to thought and odious to the soul,
2286@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@had been thrust upon me unexpectedly. This lasted of course the merest fraction
2287@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@of a second, and then the usual sense of commonplace, deadly danger, the
2288@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@possibility of a sudden onslaught and massacre, or something of the kind, which
2289@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@I saw impending, was positively welcome and composing. It pacified me, in fact,
2290@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@so much that I did not raise an alarm.
2291@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“There was an agent buttoned up inside an ulster and sleeping on a chair on deck
2292@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@within three feet of me. The yells had not awakened him; he snored very
2293@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@slightly; I left him to his slumbers and leaped ashore. I did not betray Mr.
2294@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@Kurtz—it was ordered I should never betray him—it was written I should be loyal
2295@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@to the nightmare of my choice. I was anxious to deal with this shadow by myself
2296@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@alone—and to this day I don’t know why I was so jealous of sharing with any one
2297@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@the peculiar blackness of that experience.
2298@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“As soon as I got on the bank I saw a trail—a broad trail through the grass. I
2299@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@remember the exultation with which I said to myself, ‘He can’t walk—he is
2300@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@crawling on all-fours—I’ve got him.’ The grass was wet with dew.  I strode
2301@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@rapidly with clenched fists. I fancy I had some vague notion of falling upon him
2302@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@and giving him a drubbing. I don’t know. I had some imbecile thoughts. The
2303@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@knitting old woman with the cat obtruded herself upon my memory as a most
2304@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@improper person to be sitting at the other end of such an affair. I saw a row of
2305@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@pilgrims squirting lead in the air out of Winchesters held to the hip. I thought
2306@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@I would never get back to the steamer, and imagined myself living alone and
2307@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@unarmed in the woods to an advanced age. Such silly things—you know. And I
2308@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@remember I confounded the beat of the drum with the beating of my heart, and was
2309@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@pleased at its calm regularity.
2310@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“I kept to the track though—then stopped to listen. The night was very clear; a
2311@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@dark blue space, sparkling with dew and starlight, in which black things stood
2312@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@very still. I thought I could see a kind of motion ahead of me. I was strangely
2313@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@cocksure of everything that night. I actually left the track and ran in a wide
2314@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@semicircle (I verily believe chuckling to myself) so as to get in front of that
2315@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@stir, of that motion I had seen—if indeed I had seen anything. I was
2316@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@circumventing Kurtz as though it had been a boyish game.
2317@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“I came upon him, and, if he had not heard me coming, I would have fallen over
2318@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@him, too, but he got up in time. He rose, unsteady, long, pale, indistinct, like
2319@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@a vapour exhaled by the earth, and swayed slightly, misty and silent before me;
2320@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@while at my back the fires loomed between the trees, and the murmur of many
2321@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@voices issued from the forest. I had cut him off cleverly; but when actually
2322@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@confronting him I seemed to come to my senses, I saw the danger in its right
2323@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@proportion. It was by no means over yet.  Suppose he began to shout? Though he
2324@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@could hardly stand, there was still plenty of vigour in his voice. ‘Go away—hide
2325@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@yourself,’ he said, in that profound tone. It was very awful. I glanced back. We
2326@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@were within thirty yards from the nearest fire. A black figure stood up, strode
2327@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@on long black legs, waving long black arms, across the glow. It had
2328@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@horns—antelope horns, I think—on its head. Some sorcerer, some witch-man, no
2329@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@doubt: it looked fiendlike enough. ‘Do you know what you are doing?’ I
2330@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@whispered.  ‘Perfectly,’ he answered, raising his voice for that single word: it
2331@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@sounded to me far off and yet loud, like a hail through a speaking-trumpet.  ‘If
2332@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@he makes a row we are lost,’ I thought to myself. This clearly was not a case
2333@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@for fisticuffs, even apart from the very natural aversion I had to beat that
2334@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@Shadow—this wandering and tormented thing. ‘You will be lost,’ I said—‘utterly
2335@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@lost.’ One gets sometimes such a flash of inspiration, you know. I did say the
2336@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@right thing, though indeed he could not have been more irretrievably lost than
2337@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@he was at this very moment, when the foundations of our intimacy were being
2338@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@laid—to endure—to endure—even to the end—even beyond.
2339@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“‘I had immense plans,’ he muttered irresolutely. ‘Yes,’ said I; ‘but if you try
2340@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@to shout I’ll smash your head with—’ There was not a stick or a stone near. ‘I
2341@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@will throttle you for good,’ I corrected myself. ‘I was on the threshold of
2342@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@great things,’ he pleaded, in a voice of longing, with a wistfulness of tone
2343@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@that made my blood run cold. ‘And now for this stupid scoundrel—’ ‘Your success
2344@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@in Europe is assured in any case,’ I affirmed steadily. I did not want to have
2345@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@the throttling of him, you understand—and indeed it would have been very little
2346@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@use for any practical purpose.  I tried to break the spell—the heavy, mute spell
2347@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@of the wilderness—that seemed to draw him to its pitiless breast by the
2348@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@awakening of forgotten and brutal instincts, by the memory of gratified and
2349@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@monstrous passions. This alone, I was convinced, had driven him out to the edge
2350@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@of the forest, to the bush, towards the gleam of fires, the throb of drums, the
2351@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@drone of weird incantations; this alone had beguiled his unlawful soul beyond
2352@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@the bounds of permitted aspirations. And, don’t you see, the terror of the
2353@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@position was not in being knocked on the head—though I had a very lively sense
2354@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@of that danger, too—but in this, that I had to deal with a being to whom I could
2355@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@not appeal in the name of anything high or low. I had, even like the niggers, to
2356@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@invoke him—himself—his own exalted and incredible degradation. There was nothing
2357@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@either above or below him, and I knew it. He had kicked himself loose of the
2358@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@earth. Confound the man! he had kicked the very earth to pieces. He was alone,
2359@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@and I before him did not know whether I stood on the ground or floated in the
2360@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@air. I’ve been telling you what we said—repeating the phrases we pronounced—but
2361@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@what’s the good? They were common everyday words—the familiar, vague sounds
2362@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@exchanged on every waking day of life. But what of that? They had behind them,
2363@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@to my mind, the terrific suggestiveness of words heard in dreams, of phrases
2364@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@spoken in nightmares. Soul! If anybody ever struggled with a soul, I am the man.
2365@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@And I wasn’t arguing with a lunatic either. Believe me or not, his intelligence
2366@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@was perfectly clear—concentrated, it is true, upon himself with horrible
2367@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@intensity, yet clear; and therein was my only chance—barring, of course, the
2368@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@killing him there and then, which wasn’t so good, on account of unavoidable
2369@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@noise. But his soul was mad. Being alone in the wilderness, it had looked within
2370@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@itself, and, by heavens! I tell you, it had gone mad.  I had—for my sins, I
2371@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@suppose—to go through the ordeal of looking into it myself. No eloquence could
2372@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@have been so withering to one’s belief in mankind as his final burst of
2373@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@sincerity. He struggled with himself, too.  I saw it—I heard it. I saw the
2374@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@inconceivable mystery of a soul that knew no restraint, no faith, and no fear,
2375@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@yet struggling blindly with itself.  I kept my head pretty well; but when I had
2376@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@him at last stretched on the couch, I wiped my forehead, while my legs shook
2377@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@under me as though I had carried half a ton on my back down that hill. And yet I
2378@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@had only supported him, his bony arm clasped round my neck—and he was not much
2379@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@heavier than a child.
2380@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“When next day we left at noon, the crowd, of whose presence behind the curtain
2381@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@of trees I had been acutely conscious all the time, flowed out of the woods
2382@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@again, filled the clearing, covered the slope with a mass of naked, breathing,
2383@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@quivering, bronze bodies. I steamed up a bit, then swung down stream, and two
2384@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@thousand eyes followed the evolutions of the splashing, thumping, fierce
2385@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@river-demon beating the water with its terrible tail and breathing black smoke
2386@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@into the air. In front of the first rank, along the river, three men, plastered
2387@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@with bright red earth from head to foot, strutted to and fro restlessly. When we
2388@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@came abreast again, they faced the river, stamped their feet, nodded their
2389@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@horned heads, swayed their scarlet bodies; they shook towards the fierce
2390@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@river-demon a bunch of black feathers, a mangy skin with a pendent
2391@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@tail—something that looked a dried gourd; they shouted periodically together
2392@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@strings of amazing words that resembled no sounds of human language; and the
2393@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@deep murmurs of the crowd, interrupted suddenly, were like the responses of some
2394@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@satanic litany.
2395@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“We had carried Kurtz into the pilot-house: there was more air there.  Lying on
2396@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@the couch, he stared through the open shutter. There was an eddy in the mass of
2397@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@human bodies, and the woman with helmeted head and tawny cheeks rushed out to
2398@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@the very brink of the stream. She put out her hands, shouted something, and all
2399@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@that wild mob took up the shout in a roaring chorus of articulated, rapid,
2400@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@breathless utterance.
2401@sl>Single Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“‘Do you understand this?’ I asked.
2402@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“He kept on looking out past me with fiery, longing eyes, with a mingled
2403@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@expression of wistfulness and hate. He made no answer, but I saw a smile, a
2404@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@smile of indefinable meaning, appear on his colourless lips that a moment after
2405@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@twitched convulsively. ‘Do I not?’ he said slowly, gasping, as if the words had
2406@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@been torn out of him by a supernatural power.
2407@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“I pulled the string of the whistle, and I did this because I saw the pilgrims
2408@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@on deck getting out their rifles with an air of anticipating a jolly lark. At
2409@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@the sudden screech there was a movement of abject terror through that wedged
2410@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@mass of bodies. ‘Don’t! don’t you frighten them away,’ cried some one on deck
2411@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@disconsolately. I pulled the string time after time.  They broke and ran, they
2412@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@leaped, they crouched, they swerved, they dodged the flying terror of the sound.
2413@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@The three red chaps had fallen flat, face down on the shore, as though they had
2414@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@been shot dead. Only the barbarous and superb woman did not so much as flinch,
2415@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@and stretched tragically her bare arms after us over the sombre and glittering
2416@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@river.
2417@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“And then that imbecile crowd down on the deck started their little fun, and I
2418@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@could see nothing more for smoke.
2419@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“The brown current ran swiftly out of the heart of darkness, bearing us down
2420@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@towards the sea with twice the speed of our upward progress; and Kurtz’s life
2421@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@was running swiftly, too, ebbing, ebbing out of his heart into the sea of
2422@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@inexorable time. The manager was very placid, he had no vital anxieties now, he
2423@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@took us both in with a comprehensive and satisfied glance: the ‘affair’ had come
2424@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@off as well as could be wished. I saw the time approaching when I would be left
2425@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@alone of the party of ’unsound method.’ The pilgrims looked upon me with
2426@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@disfavour. I was, so to speak, numbered with the dead. It is strange how I
2427@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@accepted this unforeseen partnership, this choice of nightmares forced upon me
2428@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@in the tenebrous land invaded by these mean and greedy phantoms.
2429@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“Kurtz discoursed. A voice! a voice! It rang deep to the very last. It survived
2430@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@his strength to hide in the magnificent folds of eloquence the barren darkness
2431@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@of his heart. Oh, he struggled! he struggled! The wastes of his weary brain were
2432@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@haunted by shadowy images now—images of wealth and fame revolving obsequiously
2433@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@round his unextinguishable gift of noble and lofty expression. My Intended, my
2434@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@station, my career, my ideas—these were the subjects for the occasional
2435@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@utterances of elevated sentiments. The shade of the original Kurtz frequented
2436@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@the bedside of the hollow sham, whose fate it was to be buried presently in the
2437@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@mould of primeval earth.  But both the diabolic love and the unearthly hate of
2438@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@the mysteries it had penetrated fought for the possession of that soul satiated
2439@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@with primitive emotions, avid of lying fame, of sham distinction, of all the
2440@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@appearances of success and power.
2441@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“Sometimes he was contemptibly childish. He desired to have kings meet him at
2442@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@railway-stations on his return from some ghastly Nowhere, where he intended to
2443@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@accomplish great things. ‘You show them you have in you something that is really
2444@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@profitable, and then there will be no limits to the recognition of your
2445@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@ability,’ he would say. ‘Of course you must take care of the motives—right
2446@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@motives—always.’ The long reaches that were like one and the same reach,
2447@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@monotonous bends that were exactly alike, slipped past the steamer with their
2448@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@multitude of secular trees looking patiently after this grimy fragment of
2449@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@another world, the forerunner of change, of conquest, of trade, of massacres, of
2450@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@blessings. I looked ahead—piloting.  ‘Close the shutter,’ said Kurtz suddenly
2451@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@one day; ‘I can’t bear to look at this.’ I did so. There was a silence. ‘Oh, but
2452@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@I will wring your heart yet!’ he cried at the invisible wilderness.
2453@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“We broke down—as I had expected—and had to lie up for repairs at the head of an
2454@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@island. This delay was the first thing that shook Kurtz’s confidence.  One
2455@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@morning he gave me a packet of papers and a photograph—the lot tied together
2456@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@with a shoe-string. ‘Keep this for me,’ he said. ‘This noxious fool’ (meaning
2457@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@the manager) ‘is capable of prying into my boxes when I am not looking.’ In the
2458@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@afternoon I saw him. He was lying on his back with closed eyes, and I withdrew
2459@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@quietly, but I heard him mutter, ‘Live rightly, die, die...’ I listened. There
2460@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@was nothing more. Was he rehearsing some speech in his sleep, or was it a
2461@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@fragment of a phrase from some newspaper article? He had been writing for the
2462@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@papers and meant to do so again, ‘for the furthering of my ideas. It’s a duty.’
2463@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“His was an impenetrable darkness. I looked at him as you peer down at a man who
2464@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@is lying at the bottom of a precipice where the sun never shines.  But I had not
2465@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@much time to give him, because I was helping the engine-driver to take to pieces
2466@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@the leaky cylinders, to straighten a bent connecting-rod, and in other such
2467@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@matters. I lived in an infernal mess of rust, filings, nuts, bolts, spanners,
2468@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@hammers, ratchet-drills—things I abominate, because I don’t get on with them. I
2469@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@tended the little forge we fortunately had aboard; I toiled wearily in a
2470@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@wretched scrap-heap—unless I had the shakes too bad to stand.
2471@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“One evening coming in with a candle I was startled to hear him say a little
2472@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@tremulously, ‘I am lying here in the dark waiting for death.’ The light was
2473@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@within a foot of his eyes. I forced myself to murmur, ‘Oh, nonsense!’ and stood
2474@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@over him as if transfixed.
2475@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“Anything approaching the change that came over his features I have never seen
2476@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@before, and hope never to see again. Oh, I wasn’t touched. I was fascinated. It
2477@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@was as though a veil had been rent. I saw on that ivory face the expression of
2478@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@sombre pride, of ruthless power, of craven terror—of an intense and hopeless
2479@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@despair. Did he live his life again in every detail of desire, temptation, and
2480@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@surrender during that supreme moment of complete knowledge? He cried in a
2481@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@whisper at some image, at some vision—he cried out twice, a cry that was no more
2482@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@than a breath:
2483@sl>Single Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“‘The horror! The horror!’
2484@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“I blew the candle out and left the cabin. The pilgrims were dining in the
2485@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@mess-room, and I took my place opposite the manager, who lifted his eyes to give
2486@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@me a questioning glance, which I successfully ignored. He leaned back, serene,
2487@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@with that peculiar smile of his sealing the unexpressed depths of his meanness.
2488@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@A continuous shower of small flies streamed upon the lamp, upon the cloth, upon
2489@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@our hands and faces. Suddenly the manager’s boy put his insolent black head in
2490@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@the doorway, and said in a tone of scathing contempt:
2491@sl>Single Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“‘Mistah Kurtz—he dead.’
2492@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“All the pilgrims rushed out to see. I remained, and went on with my dinner. I
2493@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@believe I was considered brutally callous. However, I did not eat much. There
2494@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@was a lamp in there—light, don’t you know—and outside it was so beastly, beastly
2495@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@dark. I went no more near the remarkable man who had pronounced a judgment upon
2496@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@the adventures of his soul on this earth. The voice was gone. What else had been
2497@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@there? But I am of course aware that next day the pilgrims buried something in a
2498@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@muddy hole.
2499@sl>Single Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“And then they very nearly buried me.
2500@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“However, as you see, I did not go to join Kurtz there and then. I did not.  I
2501@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@remained to dream the nightmare out to the end, and to show my loyalty to Kurtz
2502@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@once more. Destiny. My destiny! Droll thing life is—that mysterious arrangement
2503@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@of merciless logic for a futile purpose. The most you can hope from it is some
2504@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@knowledge of yourself—that comes too late—a crop of unextinguishable regrets. I
2505@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@have wrestled with death. It is the most unexciting contest you can imagine. It
2506@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@takes place in an impalpable greyness, with nothing underfoot, with nothing
2507@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@around, without spectators, without clamour, without glory, without the great
2508@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@desire of victory, without the great fear of defeat, in a sickly atmosphere of
2509@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@tepid scepticism, without much belief in your own right, and still less in that
2510@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@of your adversary. If such is the form of ultimate wisdom, then life is a
2511@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@greater riddle than some of us think it to be. I was within a hair’s breadth of
2512@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@the last opportunity for pronouncement, and I found with humiliation that
2513@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@probably I would have nothing to say. This is the reason why I affirm that Kurtz
2514@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@was a remarkable man. He had something to say. He said it. Since I had peeped
2515@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@over the edge myself, I understand better the meaning of his stare, that could
2516@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@not see the flame of the candle, but was wide enough to embrace the whole
2517@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@universe, piercing enough to penetrate all the hearts that beat in the darkness.
2518@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@He had summed up—he had judged. ‘The horror!’ He was a remarkable man. After
2519@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@all, this was the expression of some sort of belief; it had candour, it had
2520@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@conviction, it had a vibrating note of revolt in its whisper, it had the
2521@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@appalling face of a glimpsed truth—the strange commingling of desire and hate.
2522@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@And it is not my own extremity I remember best—a vision of greyness without form
2523@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@filled with physical pain, and a careless contempt for the evanescence of all
2524@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@things—even of this pain itself. No! It is his extremity that I seem to have
2525@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@lived through. True, he had made that last stride, he had stepped over the edge,
2526@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@while I had been permitted to draw back my hesitating foot. And perhaps in this
2527@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@is the whole difference; perhaps all the wisdom, and all truth, and all
2528@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@sincerity, are just compressed into that inappreciable moment of time in which
2529@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@we step over the threshold of the invisible.  Perhaps! I like to think my
2530@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@summing-up would not have been a word of careless contempt. Better his cry—much
2531@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@better. It was an affirmation, a moral victory paid for by innumerable defeats,
2532@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@by abominable terrors, by abominable satisfactions. But it was a victory! That
2533@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@is why I have remained loyal to Kurtz to the last, and even beyond, when a long
2534@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@time after I heard once more, not his own voice, but the echo of his magnificent
2535@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@eloquence thrown to me from a soul as translucently pure as a cliff of crystal.
2536@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“No, they did not bury me, though there is a period of time which I remember
2537@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@mistily, with a shuddering wonder, like a passage through some inconceivable
2538@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@world that had no hope in it and no desire. I found myself back in the
2539@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@sepulchral city resenting the sight of people hurrying through the streets to
2540@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@filch a little money from each other, to devour their infamous cookery, to gulp
2541@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@their unwholesome beer, to dream their insignificant and silly dreams. They
2542@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@trespassed upon my thoughts. They were intruders whose knowledge of life was to
2543@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@me an irritating pretence, because I felt so sure they could not possibly know
2544@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@the things I knew. Their bearing, which was simply the bearing of commonplace
2545@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@individuals going about their business in the assurance of perfect safety, was
2546@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@offensive to me like the outrageous flauntings of folly in the face of a danger
2547@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@it is unable to comprehend. I had no particular desire to enlighten them, but I
2548@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@had some difficulty in restraining myself from laughing in their faces so full
2549@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@of stupid importance. I daresay I was not very well at that time.  I tottered
2550@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@about the streets—there were various affairs to settle—grinning bitterly at
2551@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@perfectly respectable persons. I admit my behaviour was inexcusable, but then my
2552@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@temperature was seldom normal in these days. My dear aunt’s endeavours to ‘nurse
2553@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@up my strength’ seemed altogether beside the mark. It was not my strength that
2554@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@wanted nursing, it was my imagination that wanted soothing. I kept the bundle of
2555@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@papers given me by Kurtz, not knowing exactly what to do with it. His mother had
2556@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@died lately, watched over, as I was told, by his Intended. A clean-shaved man,
2557@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@with an official manner and wearing gold-rimmed spectacles, called on me one day
2558@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@and made inquiries, at first circuitous, afterwards suavely pressing, about what
2559@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@he was pleased to denominate certain ‘documents.’ I was not surprised, because I
2560@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@had had two rows with the manager on the subject out there. I had refused to
2561@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@give up the smallest scrap out of that package, and I took the same attitude
2562@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@with the spectacled man. He became darkly menacing at last, and with much heat
2563@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@argued that the Company had the right to every bit of information about its
2564@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@‘territories.’ And said he, ‘Mr. Kurtz’s knowledge of unexplored regions must
2565@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@have been necessarily extensive and peculiar—owing to his great abilities and to
2566@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@the deplorable circumstances in which he had been placed: therefore—’ I assured
2567@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@him Mr. Kurtz’s knowledge, however extensive, did not bear upon the problems of
2568@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@commerce or administration. He invoked then the name of science. ‘It would be an
2569@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@incalculable loss if,’ etc., etc. I offered him the report on the ‘Suppression
2570@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@of Savage Customs,’ with the postscriptum torn off. He took it up eagerly, but
2571@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@ended by sniffing at it with an air of contempt. ‘This is not what we had a
2572@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@right to expect,’ he remarked. ’Expect nothing else,’ I said. ‘There are only
2573@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@private letters.’ He withdrew upon some threat of legal proceedings, and I saw
2574@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@him no more; but another fellow, calling himself Kurtz’s cousin, appeared two
2575@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@days later, and was anxious to hear all the details about his dear relative’s
2576@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@last moments. Incidentally he gave me to understand that Kurtz had been
2577@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@essentially a great musician. ‘There was the making of an immense success,’ said
2578@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@the man, who was an organist, I believe, with lank grey hair flowing over a
2579@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@greasy coat-collar. I had no reason to doubt his statement; and to this day I am
2580@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@unable to say what was Kurtz’s profession, whether he ever had any—which was the
2581@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@greatest of his talents. I had taken him for a painter who wrote for the papers,
2582@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@or else for a journalist who could paint—but even the cousin (who took snuff
2583@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@during the interview) could not tell me what he had been—exactly. He was a
2584@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@universal genius—on that point I agreed with the old chap, who thereupon blew
2585@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@his nose noisily into a large cotton handkerchief and withdrew in senile
2586@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@agitation, bearing off some family letters and memoranda without importance.
2587@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@Ultimately a journalist anxious to know something of the fate of his ‘dear
2588@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@colleague’ turned up. This visitor informed me Kurtz’s proper sphere ought to
2589@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@have been politics ‘on the popular side.’ He had furry straight eyebrows,
2590@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@bristly hair cropped short, an eyeglass on a broad ribbon, and, becoming
2591@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@expansive, confessed his opinion that Kurtz really couldn’t write a bit—‘but
2592@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@heavens! how that man could talk. He electrified large meetings.  He had
2593@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@faith—don’t you see?—he had the faith. He could get himself to believe
2594@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@anything—anything. He would have been a splendid leader of an extreme party.’
2595@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@‘What party?’ I asked. ‘Any party,’ answered the other. ‘He was
2596@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@an—an—extremist.’ Did I not think so? I assented. Did I know, he asked, with a
2597@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@sudden flash of curiosity, ‘what it was that had induced him to go out there?’
2598@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@‘Yes,’ said I, and forthwith handed him the famous Report for publication, if he
2599@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@thought fit. He glanced through it hurriedly, mumbling all the time, judged ‘it
2600@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@would do,’ and took himself off with this plunder.
2601@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“Thus I was left at last with a slim packet of letters and the girl’s portrait.
2602@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@She struck me as beautiful—I mean she had a beautiful expression.  I know that
2603@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@the sunlight can be made to lie, too, yet one felt that no manipulation of light
2604@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@and pose could have conveyed the delicate shade of truthfulness upon those
2605@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@features. She seemed ready to listen without mental reservation, without
2606@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@suspicion, without a thought for herself. I concluded I would go and give her
2607@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@back her portrait and those letters myself.  Curiosity? Yes; and also some other
2608@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@feeling perhaps. All that had been Kurtz’s had passed out of my hands: his soul,
2609@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@his body, his station, his plans, his ivory, his career. There remained only his
2610@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@memory and his Intended—and I wanted to give that up, too, to the past, in a
2611@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@way—to surrender personally all that remained of him with me to that oblivion
2612@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@which is the last word of our common fate. I don’t defend myself. I had no clear
2613@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@perception of what it was I really wanted. Perhaps it was an impulse of
2614@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@unconscious loyalty, or the fulfilment of one of those ironic necessities that
2615@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@lurk in the facts of human existence. I don’t know.  I can’t tell. But I went.
2616@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“I thought his memory was like the other memories of the dead that accumulate in
2617@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@every man’s life—a vague impress on the brain of shadows that had fallen on it
2618@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@in their swift and final passage; but before the high and ponderous door,
2619@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@between the tall houses of a street as still and decorous as a well-kept alley
2620@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@in a cemetery, I had a vision of him on the stretcher, opening his mouth
2621@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@voraciously, as if to devour all the earth with all its mankind. He lived then
2622@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@before me; he lived as much as he had ever lived—a shadow insatiable of splendid
2623@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@appearances, of frightful realities; a shadow darker than the shadow of the
2624@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@night, and draped nobly in the folds of a gorgeous eloquence. The vision seemed
2625@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@to enter the house with me—the stretcher, the phantom-bearers, the wild crowd of
2626@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@obedient worshippers, the gloom of the forests, the glitter of the reach between
2627@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@the murky bends, the beat of the drum, regular and muffled like the beating of a
2628@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@heart—the heart of a conquering darkness. It was a moment of triumph for the
2629@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@wilderness, an invading and vengeful rush which, it seemed to me, I would have
2630@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@to keep back alone for the salvation of another soul. And the memory of what I
2631@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@had heard him say afar there, with the horned shapes stirring at my back, in the
2632@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@glow of fires, within the patient woods, those broken phrases came back to me,
2633@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@were heard again in their ominous and terrifying simplicity.  I remembered his
2634@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@abject pleading, his abject threats, the colossal scale of his vile desires, the
2635@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@meanness, the torment, the tempestuous anguish of his soul. And later on I
2636@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@seemed to see his collected languid manner, when he said one day, ‘This lot of
2637@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@ivory now is really mine. The Company did not pay for it. I collected it myself
2638@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@at a very great personal risk. I am afraid they will try to claim it as theirs
2639@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@though. H’m. It is a difficult case. What do you think I ought to do—resist? Eh?
2640@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@I want no more than justice.’... He wanted no more than justice—no more than
2641@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@justice. I rang the bell before a mahogany door on the first floor, and while I
2642@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@waited he seemed to stare at me out of the glassy panel—stare with that wide and
2643@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@immense stare embracing, condemning, loathing all the universe. I seemed to hear
2644@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@the whispered cry, ‘The horror! The horror!’
2645@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“The dusk was falling. I had to wait in a lofty drawing-room with three long
2646@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@windows from floor to ceiling that were like three luminous and bedraped
2647@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@columns. The bent gilt legs and backs of the furniture shone in indistinct
2648@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@curves. The tall marble fireplace had a cold and monumental whiteness. A grand
2649@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@piano stood massively in a corner; with dark gleams on the flat surfaces like a
2650@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@sombre and polished sarcophagus. A high door opened—closed. I rose.
2651@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“She came forward, all in black, with a pale head, floating towards me in the
2652@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@dusk. She was in mourning. It was more than a year since his death, more than a
2653@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@year since the news came; she seemed as though she would remember and mourn
2654@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@forever. She took both my hands in hers and murmured, ‘I had heard you were
2655@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@coming.’ I noticed she was not very young—I mean not girlish. She had a mature
2656@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@capacity for fidelity, for belief, for suffering.  The room seemed to have grown
2657@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@darker, as if all the sad light of the cloudy evening had taken refuge on her
2658@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@forehead. This fair hair, this pale visage, this pure brow, seemed surrounded by
2659@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@an ashy halo from which the dark eyes looked out at me. Their glance was
2660@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@guileless, profound, confident, and trustful. She carried her sorrowful head as
2661@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@though she were proud of that sorrow, as though she would say, ’I—I alone know
2662@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@how to mourn for him as he deserves.’ But while we were still shaking hands,
2663@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@such a look of awful desolation came upon her face that I perceived she was one
2664@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@of those creatures that are not the playthings of Time. For her he had died only
2665@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@yesterday. And, by Jove! the impression was so powerful that for me, too, he
2666@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@seemed to have died only yesterday—nay, this very minute. I saw her and him in
2667@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@the same instant of time—his death and her sorrow—I saw her sorrow in the very
2668@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@moment of his death. Do you understand? I saw them together—I heard them
2669@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@together. She had said, with a deep catch of the breath, ‘I have survived’ while
2670@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@my strained ears seemed to hear distinctly, mingled with her tone of despairing
2671@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@regret, the summing up whisper of his eternal condemnation. I asked myself what
2672@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@I was doing there, with a sensation of panic in my heart as though I had
2673@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@blundered into a place of cruel and absurd mysteries not fit for a human being
2674@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@to behold. She motioned me to a chair. We sat down. I laid the packet gently on
2675@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@the little table, and she put her hand over it.... ‘You knew him well,’ she
2676@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@murmured, after a moment of mourning silence.
2677@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“‘Intimacy grows quickly out there,’ I said. ‘I knew him as well as it is
2678@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@possible for one man to know another.’
2679@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“‘And you admired him,’ she said. ‘It was impossible to know him and not to
2680@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@admire him. Was it?’
2681@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“‘He was a remarkable man,’ I said, unsteadily. Then before the appealing fixity
2682@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@of her gaze, that seemed to watch for more words on my lips, I went on, ‘It was
2683@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@impossible not to—’
2684@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“‘Love him,’ she finished eagerly, silencing me into an appalled dumbness.  ‘How
2685@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@true! how true! But when you think that no one knew him so well as I!  I had all
2686@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@his noble confidence. I knew him best.’
2687@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“‘You knew him best,’ I repeated. And perhaps she did. But with every word
2688@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@spoken the room was growing darker, and only her forehead, smooth and white,
2689@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@remained illumined by the inextinguishable light of belief and love.
2690@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“‘You were his friend,’ she went on. ‘His friend,’ she repeated, a little
2691@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@louder. ‘You must have been, if he had given you this, and sent you to me.  I
2692@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@feel I can speak to you—and oh! I must speak. I want you—you who have heard his
2693@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@last words—to know I have been worthy of him.... It is not pride.... Yes! I am
2694@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@proud to know I understood him better than any one on earth—he told me so
2695@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@himself. And since his mother died I have had no one—no one—to—to—’
2696@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“I listened. The darkness deepened. I was not even sure whether he had given me
2697@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@the right bundle. I rather suspect he wanted me to take care of another batch of
2698@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@his papers which, after his death, I saw the manager examining under the lamp.
2699@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@And the girl talked, easing her pain in the certitude of my sympathy; she talked
2700@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@as thirsty men drink. I had heard that her engagement with Kurtz had been
2701@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@disapproved by her people. He wasn’t rich enough or something. And indeed I
2702@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@don’t know whether he had not been a pauper all his life. He had given me some
2703@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@reason to infer that it was his impatience of comparative poverty that drove him
2704@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@out there.
2705@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“’... Who was not his friend who had heard him speak once?’ she was saying.  ‘He
2706@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@drew men towards him by what was best in them.’ She looked at me with intensity.
2707@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@‘It is the gift of the great,’ she went on, and the sound of her low voice
2708@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@seemed to have the accompaniment of all the other sounds, full of mystery,
2709@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@desolation, and sorrow, I had ever heard—the ripple of the river, the soughing
2710@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@of the trees swayed by the wind, the murmurs of the crowds, the faint ring of
2711@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@incomprehensible words cried from afar, the whisper of a voice speaking from
2712@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@beyond the threshold of an eternal darkness. ‘But you have heard him! You know!’
2713@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@she cried.
2714@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“‘Yes, I know,’ I said with something like despair in my heart, but bowing my

2716@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@that shone with an unearthly glow in the darkness, in the triumphant darkness
2717@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@from which I could not have defended her—from which I could not even defend

2719@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“‘What a loss to me—to us!‘—she corrected herself with beautiful generosity;
2720@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@then added in a murmur, ‘To the world.’ By the last gleams of twilight I could
2721@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@see the glitter of her eyes, full of tears—of tears that would not fall.
2722@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“‘I have been very happy—very fortunate—very proud,’ she went on. ‘Too

2724@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“She stood up; her fair hair seemed to catch all the remaining light in a

2746@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@stream of darkness. She said suddenly very low, ‘He died as he lived.’
2747@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“‘His end,’ said I, with dull anger stirring in me, ‘was in every way worthy of
2748@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@his life.’
2749@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“‘And I was not with him,’ she murmured. My anger subsided before a feeling of
2750@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@infinite pity.
2751@sl>Single Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“‘Everything that could be done—’ I mumbled.
2752@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“‘Ah, but I believed in him more than any one on earth—more than his own mother,
2753@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@more than—himself. He needed me! Me! I would have treasured every sigh, every
2754@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@word, every sign, every glance.’
2755@sl>Single Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“I felt like a chill grip on my chest. ‘Don’t,’ I said, in a muffled voice.
2756@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“‘Forgive me. I—I have mourned so long in silence—in silence.... You were with
2757@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@him—to the last? I think of his loneliness. Nobody near to understand him as I
2758@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@would have understood. Perhaps no one to hear....’
2759@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“‘To the very end,’ I said, shakily. ‘I heard his very last words....’ I stopped
2760@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@in a fright.
2761@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“‘Repeat them,’ she murmured in a heart-broken tone. ‘I want—I
2762@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@want—something—something—to—to live with.’
2763@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“I was on the point of crying at her, ‘Don’t you hear them?’ The dusk was
2764@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@repeating them in a persistent whisper all around us, in a whisper that seemed
2765@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@to swell menacingly like the first whisper of a rising wind. ’The horror! The
2766@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@horror!’
2767@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“‘His last word—to live with,’ she insisted. ‘Don’t you understand I loved him—I
2768@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@loved him—I loved him!’
2769@sl>Single Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“I pulled myself together and spoke slowly.
2770@sl>Single Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“‘The last word he pronounced was—your name.’
2771@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@“I heard a light sigh and then my heart stood still, stopped dead short by an
2772@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@exulting and terrible cry, by the cry of inconceivable triumph and of
2773@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@unspeakable pain. ‘I knew it—I was sure!’... She knew. She was sure.  I heard
2774@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@her weeping; she had hidden her face in her hands. It seemed to me that the
2775@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@house would collapse before I could escape, that the heavens would fall upon my
2776@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@head. But nothing happened. The heavens do not fall for such a trifle. Would
2777@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@they have fallen, I wonder, if I had rendered Kurtz that justice which was his
2778@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@due? Hadn’t he said he wanted only justice? But I couldn’t. I could not tell
2779@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@her. It would have been too dark—too dark altogether....”
2780@fl>First Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@Marlow ceased, and sat apart, indistinct and silent, in the pose of a meditating
2781@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@Buddha. Nobody moved for a time. “We have lost the first of the ebb,” said the
2782@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@Director suddenly. I raised my head. The offing was barred by a black bank of
2783@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@clouds, and the tranquil waterway leading to the uttermost ends of the earth
2784@l>Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@flowed sombre under an overcast sky—seemed to lead into the heart of an immense
2785@ll>Last Line@nem>Line with No Emphasis@3@0@0@0@darkness.
