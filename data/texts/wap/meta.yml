    _War and Peace_ is a novel by the Russian author Leo Tolstoy. It is regarded
    as a central work of world literature and one of Tolstoy’s finest literary
    achievements.

    The novel chronicles the history of the French invasion of Russia and the
    impact of the Napoleonic era on Tsarist society through the stories of five
    Russian aristocratic families. Portions of an earlier version, titled _The
    Year 1805_, were serialized in The Russian Messenger from 1865 to 1867. The
    novel was first published in its entirety in 1869.

    Tolstoy said _War and Peace_ is “not a novel, even less is it a poem, and
    still less a historical chronicle”. Large sections, especially the later
    chapters, are a philosophical discussion rather than narrative. Tolstoy also
    said that the best Russian literature does not conform to standards and
    hence hesitated to call _War and Peace_ a novel. Instead, he regarded _Anna
    Karenina_ as his first true novel. The Encyclopædia Britannica states: “It
    can be argued that no single English novel attains the universality of the
    Russian writer Leo Tolstoy’s _War and Peace_.”

              Count Lyov (also Lev) Nikolayevich Tolstoy (9 September [O.S. 28
              August] 1828 – 20 November [O.S. 7 November] 1910), usually
              referred to in English as Leo Tolstoy, was a Russian writer who is
              regarded as one of the greatest authors of all time.

              Born to an aristocratic Russian family in 1828, he is best known
              for the novels _War and Peace_ (1869) and _Anna Karenina_ (1877),
              often cited as pinnacles of realist fiction. He first achieved
              literary acclaim in his twenties with his semi-autobiographical
              trilogy, _Childhood_, _Boyhood_, and _Youth_ (1852–1856), and
              _Sevastopol Sketches_ (1855), based upon his experiences in the
              Crimean War.  Tolstoy’s fiction includes dozens of short stories
              and several novellas such as _The Death of Ivan Ilyich_ (1886),
              _Family Happiness_ (1859), and _Hadji Murad_ (1912). He also wrote
              plays and numerous philosophical essays.

              In the 1870s Tolstoy experienced a profound moral crisis, followed
              by what he regarded as an equally profound spiritual awakening, as
              outlined in his non-fiction work _A Confession_ (1882). His
              literal interpretation of the ethical teachings of Jesus,
              centering on the Sermon on the Mount, caused him to become a
              fervent Christian anarchist and pacifist. Tolstoy’s ideas on
              nonviolent resistance, expressed in such works as _The Kingdom of
              God Is Within You_ (1894), were to have a profound impact on such
              pivotal 20th-century figures as Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, and
              Martin Luther King, Jr. Tolstoy also became a dedicated advocate
              of Georgism, the economic philosophy of Henry George, which he
              incorporated into his writing, particularly _Resurrection_ (1899).
