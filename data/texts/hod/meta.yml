    Heart of Darkness (1899) is a novella by Polish-English novelist Joseph
    Conrad about a voyage up the Congo River into the Congo Free State in the
    heart of Africa. Charles Marlow, the narrator, tells his story to friends
    aboard a boat anchored on the River Thames. This setting provides the frame
    for Marlow’s story of his obsession with the ivory trader Kurtz, which
    enables Conrad to create a parallel between what Conrad calls “the greatest
    town on earth”, London, and Africa as places of darkness.

    Central to Conrad’s work is the idea that there is little difference between
    so-called civilised people and those described as savages; Heart of Darkness
    raises questions about imperialism and racism.

    Originally issued as a three-part serial story in Blackwood’s Magazine to
    celebrate the thousandth edition of the magazine, Heart of Darkness has been
    widely re-published and translated into many languages. In 1998, the Modern
    Library ranked Heart of Darkness 67th on their list of the 101 best novels
    in English of the twentieth century.

              Joseph Conrad (born Józef Teodor Konrad Korzeniowski; 3 December
              1857 – 3 August 1924) was a Polish-British writer regarded as one
              of the greatest novelists to write in the English language. Though
              he did not speak English fluently until his twenties, he was a
              master prose stylist who brought a non-English sensibility into
              English literature. Conrad wrote stories and novels, many with a
              nautical setting, that depict trials of the human spirit in the
              midst of what he saw as an impassive, inscrutable universe.

              Conrad is considered an early modernist, though his works contain
              elements of 19th-century realism. His narrative style and
              anti-heroic characters have influenced numerous authors, and many
              films have been adapted from, or inspired by, his works. Numerous
              writers and critics have commented that Conrad’s fictional works,
              written largely in the first two decades of the 20th century, seem
              to have anticipated later world events.

              Writing near the peak of the British Empire, Conrad drew, among
              other things, on his native Poland’s national experiences and on
              his own experiences in the French and British merchant navies, to
              create short stories and novels that reflect aspects of a
              European-dominated world—including imperialism and colonialism—and
              that profoundly explore the human psyche.
