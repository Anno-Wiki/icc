          Galway Kinnell (February 1, 1927 â€“ October 28, 2014) was an American
          poet. He won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry for his 1982 collection,
          _Selected Poems_ and split the National Book Award for Poetry with
          Charles Wright. From 1989 to 1993 he was poet laureate for the state
          of Vermont.

          An admitted follower of Walt Whitman, Kinnell rejects the idea of
          seeking fulfillment by escaping into the imaginary world. His
          best-loved and most anthologized poems are "St. Francis and the Sow"
          and "After Making Love We Hear Footsteps".
