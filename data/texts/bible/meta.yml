    The Bible (from Koine Greek τὰ βιβλία, tà biblía, “the books”) is a
    collection of sacred texts or scriptures. Varying parts of the Bible are
    considered to be a product of divine inspiration and a record of the
    relationship between God and humans by Christians, Jews, Samaritans, and
    Rastafarians.

    What is regarded as canonical text differs depending on traditions and
    groups; a number of Bible canons have evolved, with overlapping and
    diverging contents. The Hebrew Bible overlaps with the Greek Septuagint and
    the Christian Old Testament. The Christian New Testament is a collection of
    writings by early Christians, believed to be mostly Jewish disciples of
    Christ, written in first-century Koine Greek. Among Christian denominations
    there is some disagreement about what should be included in the canon,
    primarily about the Apocrypha, a list of works that are regarded with
    varying levels of respect.

    Attitudes towards the Bible also differ among Christian groups. Roman
    Catholics, high church Anglicans, Methodists and Eastern Orthodox Christians
    stress the harmony and importance of the Bible and sacred tradition, while
    many Protestant churches, including Evangelical Anglicans, focus on the idea
    of sola scriptura, or scripture alone. This concept arose during the
    Reformation, and many denominations today support the use of the Bible as
    the only infallible source of Christian teaching. Others though, advance the
    concept of prima scriptura in contrast.

    The Bible has been a massive influence on literature and history, especially
    in the Western World, where the Gutenberg Bible was the first book printed
    using movable type. According to the March 2007 edition of Time, the
    Bible “has done more to shape literature, history, entertainment, and
    culture than any book ever written. Its influence on world history is
    unparalleled, and shows no signs of abating.” With estimated total sales
    of over 5 billion copies, it is widely considered to be the most influential
    and best-selling book of all time. As of the 2000s, it sells approximately
    100 million copies annually.

        The King James Version (KJV), also known as the King James Bible
        (KJB) or simply the Authorized Version (AV), is an English
        translation of the Christian Bible for the Church of England,
        begun in 1604 and completed as well as published in 1611 under the
        sponsorship of James VI and I. The books of the King James
        Version include the 39 books of the Old Testament, an
        intertestamental section containing 14 books of the Apocrypha, and
        the 27 books of the New Testament. The translation is noted for
        its “majesty of style”, and has been described as one of the most
        important books in English culture and a driving force in the
        shaping of the English-speaking world.

        It was first printed by Robert Barker, the King's Printer, and was
        the third translation into English approved by the English Church
        authorities: The first had been the Great Bible, commissioned in
        the reign of King Henry VIII (1535), and the second had been the
        Bishops' Bible, commissioned in the reign of Queen Elizabeth I
        (1568). On the European continent, the first generation of
        Calvinists had produced the Geneva Bible of 1560 from the original
        Hebrew and Greek Scriptures, which was influential in the writing
        of the Authorized King James Version. In January 1604, King James
        convened the Hampton Court Conference, where a new English version
        was conceived in response to the problems of the earlier
        translations perceived by the Puritans, a faction of the Church of
        England.

        James gave the translators instructions intended to ensure that
        the new version would conform to the ecclesiology of, and reflect
        the episcopal structure of, the Church of England and its belief
        in an ordained clergy. The translation was done by 47 scholars,
        all of whom were members of the Church of England. In common with
        most other translations of the period, the New Testament was
        translated from Greek, the Old Testament from Hebrew and Aramaic,
        and the Apocrypha from Greek and Latin. In the Book of Common
        Prayer (1662), the text of the Authorized Version replaced the
        text of the Great Bible for Epistle and Gospel readings (but not
        for the Psalter, which substantially retained Coverdale's Great
        Bible version), and as such was authorised by Act of Parliament.

        By the first half of the 18th century, the Authorized Version had
        become effectively unchallenged as the English translation used in
        Anglican and English Protestant churches, except for the Psalms
        and some short passages in the Book of Common Prayer of the Church
        of England. Over the course of the 18th century, the Authorized
        Version supplanted the Latin Vulgate as the standard version of
        scripture for English-speaking scholars. With the development of
        stereotype printing at the beginning of the 19th century, this
        version of the Bible became the most widely printed book in
        history, almost all such printings presenting the standard text of
        1769 extensively re-edited by Benjamin Blayney at Oxford, and
        nearly always omitting the books of the Apocrypha. Today the
        unqualified title “King James Version” usually indicates this
        Oxford standard text.

        Notes for anno.wiki
        ===================
        Unfortunately, the version most well-formatted for our purposes,
        provided by [Project Gutenberg][0], does not include the Apocrypha
        (which was, indeed, originally included in the Authorized
        Version). Furthermore, the processing issues in separating
        Chapters and Verses within each Book was unduly difficult (and
        would create significant performance issues).

        In the future anno.wiki will improve our King James Version. For
        now, please accept this is a the definitive Bible in anno.wiki for
        reference.
