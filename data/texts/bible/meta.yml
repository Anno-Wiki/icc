    The Bible (from Koine Greek τὰ βιβλία, tà biblía, “the books”) is a
    collection of sacred texts or scriptures. Varying parts of the Bible are
    considered to be a product of divine inspiration and a record of the
    relationship between God and humans by Christians, Jews, Samaritans, and
    Rastafarians.

    What is regarded as canonical text differs depending on traditions and
    groups; a number of Bible canons have evolved, with overlapping and
    diverging contents. The Hebrew Bible overlaps with the Greek Septuagint and
    the Christian Old Testament. The Christian New Testament is a collection of
    writings by early Christians, believed to be mostly Jewish disciples of
    Christ, written in first-century Koine Greek. Among Christian denominations
    there is some disagreement about what should be included in the canon,
    primarily about the Apocrypha, a list of works that are regarded with
    varying levels of respect.

    Attitudes towards the Bible also differ among Christian groups. Roman
    Catholics, high church Anglicans, Methodists and Eastern Orthodox Christians
    stress the harmony and importance of the Bible and sacred tradition, while
    many Protestant churches, including Evangelical Anglicans, focus on the idea
    of sola scriptura, or scripture alone. This concept arose during the
    Reformation, and many denominations today support the use of the Bible as
    the only infallible source of Christian teaching. Others though, advance the
    concept of prima scriptura in contrast.

    The Bible has been a massive influence on literature and history, especially
    in the Western World, where the Gutenberg Bible was the first book printed
    using movable type. According to the March 2007 edition of Time, the
    Bible “has done more to shape literature, history, entertainment, and
    culture than any book ever written. Its influence on world history is
    unparalleled, and shows no signs of abating.” With estimated total sales
    of over 5 billion copies, it is widely considered to be the most influential
    and best-selling book of all time. As of the 2000s, it sells approximately
    100 million copies annually.

              Count Lyov (also Lev) Nikolayevich Tolstoy (9 September [O.S. 28
              August] 1828 – 20 November [O.S. 7 November] 1910), usually
              referred to in English as Leo Tolstoy, was a Russian writer who is
              regarded as one of the greatest authors of all time.

              Born to an aristocratic Russian family in 1828, he is best known
              for the novels _War and Peace_ (1869) and _Anna Karenina_ (1877),
              often cited as pinnacles of realist fiction. He first achieved
              literary acclaim in his twenties with his semi-autobiographical
              trilogy, _Childhood_, _Boyhood_, and _Youth_ (1852–1856), and
              _Sevastopol Sketches_ (1855), based upon his experiences in the
              Crimean War.  Tolstoy’s fiction includes dozens of short stories
              and several novellas such as _The Death of Ivan Ilyich_ (1886),
              _Family Happiness_ (1859), and _Hadji Murad_ (1912). He also wrote
              plays and numerous philosophical essays.

              In the 1870s Tolstoy experienced a profound moral crisis, followed
              by what he regarded as an equally profound spiritual awakening, as
              outlined in his non-fiction work _A Confession_ (1882). His
              literal interpretation of the ethical teachings of Jesus,
              centering on the Sermon on the Mount, caused him to become a
              fervent Christian anarchist and pacifist. Tolstoy’s ideas on
              nonviolent resistance, expressed in such works as _The Kingdom of
              God Is Within You_ (1894), were to have a profound impact on such
              pivotal 20th-century figures as Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, and
              Martin Luther King, Jr. Tolstoy also became a dedicated advocate
              of Georgism, the economic philosophy of Henry George, which he
              incorporated into his writing, particularly _Resurrection_ (1899).
