    Shakespeare’s sonnets are poems that William Shakespeare wrote on a variety
    of themes. When discussing or referring to Shakespeare’s sonnets, it is
    almost always a reference to the 154 sonnets that were first published all
    together in a quarto in 1609; however there are six additional sonnets that
    Shakespeare wrote and included in the plays Romeo and Juliet, Henry V and
    Love’s Labour’s Lost.

        The primary source of Shakespeare’s sonnets is a quarto published in
        1609 titled Shake-speare’s Sonnets. It contains 154 sonnets, which are
        followed by the long poem “A Lover’s Complaint”. Thirteen copies of the
        quarto have survived in fairly good shape from the 1609 edition, which
        is the only edition; there were no other printings. There is evidence in
        a note on the title page of one of the extant copies that the great
        Elizabethan actor Edward Alleyn bought a copy in June 1609 for one
        shilling.

        The sonnets cover such themes as the passage of time, love, infidelity,
        jealousy, beauty and mortality. The first 126 are addressed to a young
        man; the last 28 are either addressed to, or refer to a woman. (Sonnets
        138 and 144 had previously been published in the 1599 miscellany The
        Passionate Pilgrim).

        The title of the quarto, Shakespeare’s Sonnets, is consistent with the
        entry in the Stationer Register. The title appears in upper case
        lettering on the title page, where it is followed by the phrase “Neuer
        before Imprinted”. The title also appears every time the quarto is
        opened. That the author’s name in a possessive form is part of the title
        sets it apart from all other sonnet collections of the time, except for
        one — Sir Philip Sidney’s posthumous 1591 publication that is titled,
        Syr. P.S. his Astrophel and Stella, which is considered one of
        Shakespeare’s most important models. Sidney’s title may have inspired
        Shakespeare, particularly if the “W.H.” of Shakespeare’s dedication is
        Sidney’s nephew and heir, William Herbert. The idea that the persona
        referred to as the speaker of the Shakespeare’s sonnets might be
        Shakespeare himself, is aggressively repudiated by scholars, however,
        the title of the quarto does seem to encourage that kind of
        speculation.

        The first 17 poems, traditionally called the procreation sonnets, are
        addressed to the young man – urging him to marry and have children in
        order to immortalize his beauty by passing it to the next generation.
        Other sonnets express the speaker’s love for the young man; brood upon
        loneliness, death, and the transience of life; seem to criticise the
        young man for preferring a rival poet; express ambiguous feelings for
        the speaker’s mistress; and pun on the poet’s name. The final two
        sonnets are allegorical treatments of Greek epigrams referring to the
        “little love-god” Cupid.

        The publisher, Thomas Thorpe, entered the book in the Stationers’
        Register on 20 May 1609:

        > Tho. Thorpe. Entred for his copie under the handes of master Wilson
        > and master Lownes Wardenes a booke called Shakespeares sonnettes vjd.

        Whether Thorpe used an authorised manuscript from Shakespeare or an
        unauthorised copy is unknown. George Eld printed the quarto, and the run
        was divided between the booksellers William Aspley and John Wright.

              ==============

              William Shakespeare (bapt. 26 April 1564 – 23 April 1616) was an
              English poet, playwright and actor, widely regarded as the
              greatest writer in the English language and the world’s greatest
              dramatist. He is often called England’s national poet and the
              “Bard of Avon”. His extant works, including collaborations,
              consist of approximately 39 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative
              poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His
              plays have been translated into every major living language and
              are performed more often than those of any other playwright.

              Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon,
              Warwickshire. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with
              whom he had three children: Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith.
              Sometime between 1585 and 1592, he began a successful career in
              London as an actor, writer, and part-owner of a playing company
              called the Lord Chamberlain’s Men, later known as the King’s Men.
              At age 49 (around 1613), he appears to have retired to Stratford,
              where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare’s
              private life survive; this has stimulated considerable speculation
              about such matters as his physical appearance, his sexuality, his
              religious beliefs, and whether the works attributed to him were
              written by others. Such theories are often criticised for failing
              to adequately note that few records survive of most commoners of
              the period.

              Shakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589 and
              1613. His early plays were primarily comedies and histories and
              are regarded as some of the best work produced in these genres.
              Until about 1608, he wrote mainly tragedies, among them Hamlet,
              Othello, King Lear, and Macbeth, all considered to be among the
              finest works in the English language. In the last phase of his
              life, he wrote tragicomedies (also known as romances) and
              collaborated with other playwrights.

              Many of Shakespeare’s plays were published in editions of varying
              quality and accuracy in his lifetime. However, in 1623, two fellow
              actors and friends of Shakespeare’s, John Heminges and Henry
              Condell, published a more definitive text known as the First
              Folio, a posthumous collected edition of Shakespeare’s dramatic
              works that included all but two of his plays. The volume was
              prefaced with a poem by Ben Jonson, in which Jonson presciently
              hails Shakespeare in a now-famous quote as “not of an age, but for
              all time”.

              Throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, Shakespeare’s works have
              been continually adapted and rediscovered by new movements in
              scholarship and performance. His plays remain popular and are
              studied, performed, and reinterpreted through various cultural and
              political contexts around the world.
