    The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, often shortened to Hamlet
    (/ˈhæmlɪt/), is a tragedy written by William Shakespeare sometime between
    1599 and 1602. Set in Denmark, the play depicts Prince Hamlet and his
    revenge against his uncle, Claudius, who has murdered Hamlet’s father in
    order to seize his throne and marry Hamlet’s mother.

    Hamlet is Shakespeare’s longest play and is considered among the most
    powerful and influential works of world literature, with a story capable of
    “seemingly endless retelling and adaptation by others”. It was one of
    Shakespeare’s most popular works during his lifetime and still ranks among
    his most performed, topping the performance list of the Royal Shakespeare
    Company and its predecessors in Stratford-upon-Avon since 1879. It has
    inspired many other writers—from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Charles
    Dickens to James Joyce and Iris Murdoch—and has been described as “the
    world’s most filmed story after Cinderella”.

    The story of Shakespeare’s Hamlet was derived from the legend of Amleth,
    preserved by 13th-century chronicler Saxo Grammaticus in his Gesta Danorum,
    as subsequently retold by the 16th-century scholar François de Belleforest.
    Shakespeare may also have drawn on an earlier Elizabethan play known today
    as the Ur-Hamlet, though some scholars believe Shakespeare wrote the
    Ur-Hamlet, later revising it to create the version of Hamlet we now have. He
    almost certainly wrote his version of the title role for his fellow actor,
    Richard Burbage, the leading tragedian of Shakespeare’s time. In the 400
    years since its inception, the role has been performed by numerous highly
    acclaimed actors in each successive century.

    Three different early versions of the play are extant: the First Quarto (Q1,
    1603); the Second Quarto (Q2, 1604); and the First Folio (F1, 1623). Each
    version includes lines and entire scenes missing from the others. The play’s
    structure and depth of characterisation have inspired much critical
    scrutiny. One such example is the centuries-old debate about Hamlet’s
    hesitation to kill his uncle, which some see as merely a plot device to
    prolong the action but which others argue is a dramatisation of the complex
    philosophical and ethical issues that surround cold-blooded murder,
    calculated revenge, and thwarted desire. More recently, psychoanalytic
    critics have examined Hamlet’s unconscious desires, while feminist critics
    have re-evaluated and attempted to rehabilitate the often-maligned
    characters of Ophelia and Gertrude.

        Three early editions of the text have survived, making attempts to
        establish a single “authentic” text problematic and inconclusive Each
        surviving edition differs from the other:

        - First Quarto (Q1): In 1603 the booksellers Nicholas Ling and John
          Trundell published, and Valentine Simmes printed, the so-called “bad”
          first quarto, under the name The Tragicall Historie of Hamlet Prince
          of Denmarke. Q1 contains just over half of the text of the later
          second quarto.
        - Second Quarto (Q2): In 1604 Nicholas Ling published, and James Roberts
          printed, the second quarto, under the same name as the first. Some
          copies are dated 1605, which may indicate a second impression;
          consequently, Q2 is often dated “1604/5”. Q2 is the longest early
          edition, although it omits about 77 lines found in F1 (most likely to
          avoid offending James I’s queen, Anne of Denmark)
        - First Folio (F1): In 1623 Edward Blount and William and Isaac Jaggard
          published The Tragedie of Hamlet, Prince of Denmarke in the First
          Folio, the first edition of Shakespeare’s Complete Works.

        Other folios and quartos were subsequently published—including John
        Smethwick’s Q3, Q4, and Q5 (1611–37)—but these are regarded as
        derivatives of the first three editions.

        Early editors of Shakespeare’s works, beginning with Nicholas Rowe
        (1709) and Lewis Theobald (1733), combined material from the two
        earliest sources of Hamlet available at the time, Q2 and F1. Each text
        contains material that the other lacks, with many minor differences in
        wording: scarcely 200 lines are identical in the two. Editors have
        combined them in an effort to create one “inclusive” text that reflects
        an imagined “ideal” of Shakespeare’s original. Theobald’s version became
        standard for a long time, and his “full text” approach continues to
        influence editorial practice to the present day. Some contemporary
        scholarship, however, discounts this approach, instead considering “an
        authentic Hamlet an unrealisable ideal. ... there are texts of this play
        but no text”. The 2006 publication by Arden Shakespeare of different
        Hamlet texts in different volumes is perhaps evidence of this shifting
        focus and emphasis. Other editors have continued to argue the need for
        well-edited editions taking material from all versions of the play.
        Colin Burrow has argued that “most of us should read a text that is made
        up by conflating all three versions ... it’s about as likely that
        Shakespeare wrote: ‘To be or not to be, ay, there’s the point’ [in Q1],
        as that he wrote the works of Francis Bacon. I suspect most people just
        won’t want to read a three-text play ... [multi-text editions are] a
        version of the play that is out of touch with the needs of a wider
        public.”

        Traditionally, editors of Shakespeare’s plays have divided them into
        five acts. None of the early texts of Hamlet, however, were arranged
        this way, and the play’s division into acts and scenes derives from a
        1676 quarto. Modern editors generally follow this traditional division
        but consider it unsatisfactory; for example, after Hamlet drags
        Polonius’s body out of Gertrude’s bedchamber, there is an act-break
        after which the action appears to continue uninterrupted.

        The discovery in 1823 of Q1—whose existence had been quite
        unsuspected—caused considerable interest and excitement, raising many
        questions of editorial practice and interpretation. Scholars immediately
        identified apparent deficiencies in Q1, which was instrumental in the
        development of the concept of a Shakespearean “bad quarto”. Yet Q1 has
        value: it contains stage directions (such as Ophelia entering with a
        lute and her hair down) that reveal actual stage practices in a way that
        Q2 and F1 do not; it contains an entire scene (usually labelled 4.6)
        that does not appear in either Q2 or F1; and it is useful for comparison
        with the later editions. The major deficiency of Q1 is in the language:
        particularly noticeable in the opening lines of the famous “To be, or
        not to be” soliloquy: “To be, or not to be, aye there’s the point. / To
        die, to sleep, is that all? Aye all: / No, to sleep, to dream, aye marry
        there it goes.” However, the scene order is more coherent, without the
        problems of Q2 and F1 of Hamlet seeming to resolve something in one
        scene and enter the next drowning in indecision. New Cambridge editor
        Kathleen Irace has noted that “Q1’s more linear plot design is certainly
        easier [...] to follow [...] but the simplicity of the Q1 plot
        arrangement eliminates the alternating plot elements that correspond to
        Hamlet’s shifts in mood.”

        Q1 is considerably shorter than Q2 or F1 and may be a memorial
        reconstruction of the play as Shakespeare’s company performed it, by an
        actor who played a minor role (most likely Marcellus). Scholars disagree
        whether the reconstruction was pirated or authorised. It is suggested by
        Irace that Q1 is an abridged version intended especially for travelling
        productions, thus the question of length may be considered as separate
        from issues of poor textual quality.  Editing Q1 thus poses problems in
        whether or not to “correct” differences from Q2 and F. Irace, in her
        introduction to Q1, wrote that “I have avoided as many other alterations
        as possible, because the differences...are especially intriguing...I
        have recorded a selection of Q2/F readings in the collation.” The idea
        that Q1 is not riddled with error but is instead eminently fit for the
        stage has led to at least 28 different Q1 productions since 1881. Other
        productions have used the probably superior Q2 and Folio texts, but used
        Q1’s running order, in particular moving the to be or not to be
        soliloquy earlier.  Developing this, some editors such as Jonathan Bate
        have argued that Q2 may represent “a ‘reading’ text as opposed to a
        ‘performance’ one” of Hamlet, analogous to how modern films released on
        disc may include deleted scenes: an edition containing all of
        Shakespeare’s material for the play for the pleasure of readers, so not
        representing the play as it would have been staged.

              ==============

              William Shakespeare (bapt. 26 April 1564 – 23 April 1616) was an
              English poet, playwright and actor, widely regarded as the
              greatest writer in the English language and the world’s greatest
              dramatist. He is often called England’s national poet and the
              “Bard of Avon”. His extant works, including collaborations,
              consist of approximately 39 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative
              poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His
              plays have been translated into every major living language and
              are performed more often than those of any other playwright.

              Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon,
              Warwickshire. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with
              whom he had three children: Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith.
              Sometime between 1585 and 1592, he began a successful career in
              London as an actor, writer, and part-owner of a playing company
              called the Lord Chamberlain’s Men, later known as the King’s Men.
              At age 49 (around 1613), he appears to have retired to Stratford,
              where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare’s
              private life survive; this has stimulated considerable speculation
              about such matters as his physical appearance, his sexuality, his
              religious beliefs, and whether the works attributed to him were
              written by others. Such theories are often criticised for failing
              to adequately note that few records survive of most commoners of
              the period.

              Shakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589 and
              1613. His early plays were primarily comedies and histories and
              are regarded as some of the best work produced in these genres.
              Until about 1608, he wrote mainly tragedies, among them Hamlet,
              Othello, King Lear, and Macbeth, all considered to be among the
              finest works in the English language. In the last phase of his
              life, he wrote tragicomedies (also known as romances) and
              collaborated with other playwrights.

              Many of Shakespeare’s plays were published in editions of varying
              quality and accuracy in his lifetime. However, in 1623, two fellow
              actors and friends of Shakespeare’s, John Heminges and Henry
              Condell, published a more definitive text known as the First
              Folio, a posthumous collected edition of Shakespeare’s dramatic
              works that included all but two of his plays. The volume was
              prefaced with a poem by Ben Jonson, in which Jonson presciently
              hails Shakespeare in a now-famous quote as “not of an age, but for
              all time”.

              Throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, Shakespeare’s works have
              been continually adapted and rediscovered by new movements in
              scholarship and performance. His plays remain popular and are
              studied, performed, and reinterpreted through various cultural and
              political contexts around the world.
