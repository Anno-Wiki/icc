    Macbeth (/məkˈbɛθ/; full title The Tragedy of Macbeth) is a tragedy by
    William Shakespeare; it is thought to have been first performed in 1606.  It
    dramatises the damaging physical and psychological effects of political
    ambition on those who seek power for its own sake. Of all the plays that
    Shakespeare wrote during the reign of James I, who was patron of
    Shakespeare's acting company, Macbeth most clearly reflects the playwright's
    relationship with his sovereign. It was first published in the Folio of
    1623, possibly from a prompt book, and is Shakespeare's shortest tragedy.

    A brave Scottish general named Macbeth receives a prophecy from a trio of
    witches that one day he will become King of Scotland. Consumed by ambition
    and spurred to action by his wife, Macbeth murders King Duncan and takes the
    Scottish throne for himself. He is then wracked with guilt and paranoia.
    Forced to commit more and more murders to protect himself from enmity and
    suspicion, he soon becomes a tyrannical ruler. The bloodbath and consequent
    civil war swiftly take Macbeth and Lady Macbeth into the realms of madness
    and death.

    Shakespeare's source for the story is the account of Macbeth, King of
    Scotland; Macduff; and Duncan in Holinshed's Chronicles (1587), a history of
    England, Scotland, and Ireland familiar to Shakespeare and his
    contemporaries, although the events in the play differ extensively from the
    history of the real Macbeth. The events of the tragedy are usually
    associated with the execution of Henry Garnet for complicity in the
    Gunpowder Plot of 1605.

    In the backstage world of theatre, some believe that the play is cursed, and
    will not mention its title aloud, referring to it instead as "The Scottish
    Play". Over the course of many centuries, the play has attracted some of the
    most renowned actors to the roles of Macbeth and Lady Macbeth. It has been
    adapted to film, television, opera, novels, comics, and other media.

              ==============

              William Shakespeare (bapt. 26 April 1564 – 23 April 1616) was an
              English poet, playwright and actor, widely regarded as the
              greatest writer in the English language and the world’s greatest
              dramatist. He is often called England’s national poet and the
              “Bard of Avon”. His extant works, including collaborations,
              consist of approximately 39 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative
              poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His
              plays have been translated into every major living language and
              are performed more often than those of any other playwright.

              Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon,
              Warwickshire. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with
              whom he had three children: Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith.
              Sometime between 1585 and 1592, he began a successful career in
              London as an actor, writer, and part-owner of a playing company
              called the Lord Chamberlain’s Men, later known as the King’s Men.
              At age 49 (around 1613), he appears to have retired to Stratford,
              where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare’s
              private life survive; this has stimulated considerable speculation
              about such matters as his physical appearance, his sexuality, his
              religious beliefs, and whether the works attributed to him were
              written by others. Such theories are often criticised for failing
              to adequately note that few records survive of most commoners of
              the period.

              Shakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589 and
              1613. His early plays were primarily comedies and histories and
              are regarded as some of the best work produced in these genres.
              Until about 1608, he wrote mainly tragedies, among them Hamlet,
              Othello, King Lear, and Macbeth, all considered to be among the
              finest works in the English language. In the last phase of his
              life, he wrote tragicomedies (also known as romances) and
              collaborated with other playwrights.

              Many of Shakespeare’s plays were published in editions of varying
              quality and accuracy in his lifetime. However, in 1623, two fellow
              actors and friends of Shakespeare’s, John Heminges and Henry
              Condell, published a more definitive text known as the First
              Folio, a posthumous collected edition of Shakespeare’s dramatic
              works that included all but two of his plays. The volume was
              prefaced with a poem by Ben Jonson, in which Jonson presciently
              hails Shakespeare in a now-famous quote as “not of an age, but for
              all time”.

              Throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, Shakespeare’s works have
              been continually adapted and rediscovered by new movements in
              scholarship and performance. His plays remain popular and are
              studied, performed, and reinterpreted through various cultural and
              political contexts around the world.
