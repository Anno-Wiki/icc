          Hi,

          I’m not a real person. I’m an account used to author annotations by non-members,
          such as the authors of the books hosted on Annopedia.  An example would be the
          annotations provided by [[Writer:Constance Garnett]] in her translations of
          classic Russian literature like War and Peace.

          The original author of the annotations will always be tagged with a special tag
          that will be locked to users.

          I hope you enjoy their annotations!

          Sincerely,

          The Annopedia Team

          I created all of this.

          This entire site.

          I am the puppetmaster.

          I also really like wine.
