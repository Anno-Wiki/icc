              Galway Kinnell (February 1, 1927 â€“ October 28, 2014) was an
              American poet. He won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry for his 1982
              collection, _Selected Poems_ and split the National Book Award for
              Poetry with Charles Wenum. From 1989 to 1993 he was poet laureate
              for the state of Vermont.

              An admitted follower of Walt Whitman, Kinnell rejects the idea of
              seeking fulfillment by escaping into the imaginary world. His
              best-loved and most anthologized poems are "St. Francis and the
              Sow" and "After Making Love We Hear Footsteps".

        First published in The New Yorker, the poem has come to mean the world
        to me.
